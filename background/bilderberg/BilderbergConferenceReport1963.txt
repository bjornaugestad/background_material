The twelfth ~ilderberg Meeting was held on 29, 30 and 31 March 1g6
3
at
th~ H6tel Martinez, Cannes (France) under the chairmanship ofH.R.H. the
Pnnce of the Netherlands.
Participants numbered ninety and represented the United States Canada
and fifteen European countries together with various international ~rganiza­
tions. They were drawn from among political leaders (members of govern-
ments and parliamentarians) and leading figures in business, journalism, the
civil service (national and international), the liberal professions and trade-
union organizations.
In accordance with the rules of procedure adopted at each meeting, all
participants spoke on an absolutely personal basis without committing any
government or organization to which they might belong. In order to facilitate
complete frankness, the discussions were confidential and no representatives
of the press were admitted. A short press release in which the Chairman's
was the only name mentioned was distributed beforehand but no further re-
lease was issued at the conclusion of the meeting.
Three items were included on the Agenda:
I - The balance ofpower in the light ofrecent international developments.
II - Trade relations between the U.S.A. and Europe in the light of the ne-
gotiations for Britain's entry into the Common Market.
ill - Trade relations between the Western world and the developing coun-
tries (tarifti, quotas, commodity arrangements! etc.). . . .
M. I This item will cover changes in power relations-poli?cal, eco~o~c
qd naiUtary--between the Communist and Western countnes and ms1de
.mgroup.
excluding certain current economic-political problems which have arisen as
a result ofthe failure of the Brussels discussions;
- in dealing with item II, to concentrate on future prospects, more especial-
ly in regard to the "Kennedy Round" and certain specific problems such as
the co-ordination of agricultural policies.
Since certain participants were absent when the meeting opened, item III
was dealt with first although various participants returned to this item during
the last session. The original order of the various items has been adhered to in
the present text.
In accordance with another of the Bilderberg Meetings' rules, aimed at
preserving the confidential nature of the discussions, none of the participants
is mentioned by name in the present report.

but to ~eet it purely and simply could only create a dangeroUl neutralisnt,
es~yifit took the form ofa sort of"anti-colonialism" directed at.America.
The author went on to discuss the circumstances surrounding the recent
breakdown of negotiations between the United Kingdom. and the E.E.U
and expressed his bitter regret concerning them. The breakdown, he said,
was a blow from which European integration might never recover. 'l'rue,: the
French rejection was delivered in accordance with the provisions ofthe Rome
Treaty which calls for unanimity among governments of the Community as
regards the admission of new members but it ran counter to the only line
of action which would enable genuine European union to develop, namely
compromise between the wishes of the various European countries, eacll
being merely a part of a greater whole. The author of the note considered
that what was still more serious was the fact that, at his press conference, Gene-
ral de Gaulle should have let it be understood that the choice was not between
Paris and London but between Paris and Washington, on whose behalfGreat
Britain W{)u}d have played the role of "Trojan Horse" within the Common
Market.. In actual fact, he wrote, on the basis of their attachment to NATO
and -their acceptance ofAmerican leadership, Italy and the Benelux countries
might eqJJally well be considered .as "Trojan Horses".
The- author of the note concluded by emphasising that the S&viet thteat

not. to avo1 ~y repnsals or controversial statements likely to harm French
~auonal prestige. If pressure were considered necessary, it should be applied
m ~e ~rrn.of unders~a~ding and friendship. Other French speakers argued
on smrilar lines. A Bntish speaker wished to dissociate himself from certain
criticisms levelled at the General whom he considered a great man, a great
Frenchman and even a great European.
The pers~t~nce of the. Soviet ~reat emphasised in the note was raised by
several participants dunng the discussion. A British speaker, supported by
a German participant, defined the policy of the USSR as follows:
- not to maintain the existing balance but to tip the scales in favour of the
USSR;
- for this purpose, to exploit every opportunity provided by the West.
Khrushchev had merely recognised that this needed time. At the present
time, moreover, given the fact that the situation in Cuba, the Middle East
and Africa, not to mention China, was not very favourable from his point of
view, his primary objective remained the Western countries: Berlin was still
Khrushchev's main concern, especially if one bore in mind his apprehension
regarding the possible provision ofnuclear weapons to the Federal Republic.
The German speaker did not a priori include Cuba in the list of Russian
defeats; it was rather that Khrushchev had wanted to avoid full-scale conflict
in an area where the military conditions were particularly unfavourable from
his point of view. At the present time Khrushchev considered Cuba as a
political bridgehead. In the German speaker's opinion, the danger still lay in
Berlin.
The uneasy situation currently prevailing within the Atlantic Alliance was
generally recognised and a very large number of speakers sought to analyse
the causes and the symptoms on both sides of the A~antic. What are the fea-
tures of the Atlantic crisis? Several participants attempted to define them and
to recommend steps to eliminate them. . . .
The main elements brought out in the course ofthe discussion may be ~sted
as follows although the same discussion revealed that they were closely mter-
connected:
- the fallure ofthe Brussels negotiations, . d St t ,
- the doubts sometimes expressed in Europe as to the ~rut~ . a~:

~-gov.emm~twas 1~dmiss1ble because ofits unilateral nature. Emphasis-
"ibg :the commumty quality of the Europe to be built, implying a spirit of
aoJidarity which went beyond individual nations, this speaker advanced the
WD that French diplomacy no longer believed in this concept and preferred
en confi.ont its partners with a fait accompli.
But a French participant belonging to the government majority group
~tied that the cessation of European construction dated back rather to
Vi April1g62 when the "Fouchet Plan" was rejected, a plan which represented
aninitialstagein thatitprovidedfor periodical meetings between governments,
a clearly..:defined organization covering defence and foreign and cultural policy
which may have been modest but which could have been the embryo of a
greater organization. The French attitude in January 1963, said the speaker,
was ~lely due to the fact that it was impossible for Great Britain to accept
alltheconditionsofthe Rome Treaty. The building of Europe meant accept-
ing one's lhare of the responsibilities and burdens. . .
Addressing the meeting again towards the close of the discuss10n, the
Belgian speaker emphasised that, as a supporter ?:an int~~at:d ~urope
;J;ather than of a simple alliance, he considered Bntish partlapatlon m the

ditiiJfib. of the present American presidential team. But was it always pos-
'neuked, to foresee.the future? And should not the confidence which the
~ sought be reC1procal?
The disproportion betwee.n the contributio~ of the United States to joint
def'elioe and that made by 1ts partners was likewise recognised by a British
participant as a source of uneasiness on the European side; such a dispropor-
tion could ~~t con?nue indefinitely. This point was expanded on by the
French parti.C1pant JUSt referred to: when NATO was conceived, he pointed
out, the imbalance was in accordance with reality because of America's
monopoly in the atomic field-a field which, however, had nothing like the
importance which it now possessed. Since then, Europe had achieved a specta-
cular "recovery" and the feeling was developing that the Alliance must be
''rebalanced" and Europe strengthened in close co-operation with America.
But the United States wanted to maintain its monopoly, not only as regards
manufacture of nuclear weapons but also as regards the decisions concerning
them. America was especially apprehensive that it might be drawn into
a conflict through error or some rash action. Accordingly, said this speaker,
everything proposed by America-a multinational or even a multilateral
force--seeks to convey the impression of a certain sharing of responsibility
while retaining the sovereign right "to press the button" and it was this ap-
proachwhichFranceopposed. In addition, the speakercontinued, it is not desir-
able that the Alliance should seek to restrict the efforts of the Europeans to
tb.e.c'conventional" field by allotting them, as it were, the role of"footsloggers".
Finally, atthe present time, the military effort in the nuclear sector conditione~,
ao to speak, however regrettable this might be, the development of an atom.tc
in.duitry--a field in which the lack ofbalance is also very pronounced. .
In reference to the United States' "over-kill capacity" which had previOusly
bee# :cited by a German participant as the main element in preserving world
~, m American participant emphasised that the best deterre~t was .the
OIIC wiUGh was ~'technically" capable of ensuring victory and that 1t was vttal

A Bnttsh p~rtlapant .a~k.e~ whether it w.as certain that Europe was ready
to assume all Its responsibilities, more especially of a financial order, to estab-
lish a genuine balance with the United States? At the present time, it would
seem not.
Returning to the problem of the relation between nuclear forces and con-
ventional forces in NATO strategy which had been raised by a German
participant, two speakers from that country emphasised that "flexibility"
in the choice of possible reprisals was essential. A defence system which only
had nuclear forces available would find itself in the position of a policeman
with nothing but a sub-machine gun to preserve order. It was up to the allied
powers to make their contribution in those complementary fields where
inadequacies were apparent. On the other hand, said one of these speakers,
ifwe invest too much in conventional arms (which is not the case at present
inEurope) we runtheriskofweakening the "credibility" of our deterrent force.
While not denying that the Alliance was confronted with various problems,
an American participant contended that, on the basis ofits practical operation,
its balance-sheet was a positive one and that substantial progress had been
made since 1949. In discussing the American nuclear monopoly, it should
be remembered that this only applied to the possession of such weapons. The
speaker referred to the plans which had been drawn up to allow for the use of
nuclear and conventional weapons alike and pointed out that such plans had
been made by an integrated inter-allied team comprising virtually all member
nations. Similarly, SHAPE, an organization possessing a regional structure,
received its orders from the "Standing Group" which, in turn, was govem:d
by the NATO "Military Committee" in which the poli~cal lines ~ere .latd
down by 15 nations. The military command merely applied these ~ec~ves.
The plans, drawn up with great care in order to conform to those directives,
were designed to meet two primary considerations:
- to ensure adequate control especially involving avoidance of premature
' · b 1 1 this b · a political
use ofatomic weapons without orders from a btg er eve , emg
element ofkey importance; . . . al oli
-toensure,in the nuclearfield, an adequate andsuffictendy raptd repns P cy.
The danger of a proliferation of national nuclear weapons was raised by
. • . . th F ch t's decision to create

~~-~participant, already mentioned several times and who seth' If
• -..,.hlmi11 the li f th xmse
-1! g po cy o e French government at this junctu
IIIMI-..i dtf'ended the r~asons underlying this decision. Apart from ~~
a.lteady mentioned above (uncertainty as to the future th
~'·-~-monopoly, the necessary development of a nuclear industry)' the
~--~~ go~ent c~nsidered that any nuclear force should be subject'to ~
11111itld·authonty which, for the ~oment, is national in nature since only
IIIIQO-LS1te.Ltes can ~ume the crushin~ responsibility ofusing it. It might one
&ybeposstbi; to enVISas:e a supran~tl.onal force but this was not a reality as
(I)I'J:lbW. ~ordid France W!Sh to place xts defence (i.e., having regard to possible
.&lute developments, its whole destiny) in any other hands but is own. In
't1liis respect, the French followed exactly the same reasoning as the British.
Why, asked the speaker, should something which was good for the British be
bad for the French? France, too, wished to be able to play a deterrent part.
.AJiother reason why a nuclear force was necessary was that it enabled the
<Smaller countries to "weigh more heavily in the scales" as regards political
an.d military affairs. It was impossible to speak of dissemination in this con-
uexion, said the speaker, since the French government could not, as certain
'ObServations might have suggested, be compared to some sort of potentate or
~ilhrer" threatening world peace. Such dissemination, moreover, had al-
~ begun and might progress still further tomorrow without the United
States being in a position to resist it. Furthermore, the policy in question was
one which had reached a point of no return and had already been initiated
by the leaders of the Fourth Republic. . .
The fact remained said an American participant, that the proliferatiOn of
mtdear weapons cons'tituted a real danger since the possible launching ofeven
~!llil-•m~P ·luo two inissiles could unleash a nuclear holocaust. In this connexion, there
cJ;a.iii&ti'11. tendencyto think ofnuclear weapons as a mere extension ofconventional

~ merge m a enationalized entity and 1t was for this reason that France
did not support the concept of a multilateral force as suggested at Nassa
force which would be deprived ofnuclear warheads, provision of which wo
u,1~
depend on American goodwill. u
Replying to the previous speaker, an American participant set out his
country's aims as follows :
- to encourage a strong Europe and hence to encourage its economic and
political integration;
- to create and strengthen arrangements facilitating increased Atlantic
co-operation.
The nuclear defence of the West is indivisible : the defence of Europe is
vital to the United States, the defence of Europe depends on the American
deterrent. Because ofthis, the United States committment was of a permanent
nature, as demonstrated by the presence of thousands of Americans based in
Europe. Having expressed these convictions, the speaker went on to say
that it was necessary to take joint action to maintain the stability of our
economies, to strengthen our military potential and to increase our assistance
to new nations, more especially to keep them out of the grasp of the East.
In discussing the difficult problem of the control of atomic weapons, a diffi-
culty arose which had already been mentioned by a German participant:
technology had gone so much further than had the traditional arrangements
betweensovereign states that it was important to find new institutional methods
for exercising our power over the terrible weapons available to us. There were
three possibilities in regard to that power ofcontrol:
- leave things as they were, relying on the United States in the hope that
the situation would not change. This implied an increased dependence of the
free world on the United States and did not take account of the present
British potential nor of the future French potential;
- let things follow their course, more especially as regards the French for~e
and its influence on the latent desire of certain other countries to possess the.tr
own nuclear force, with the consequent danger of proliferation already men-
~;
- to co~r NATO as an atomic power in its own right and hence .estab-
- at eny rate among certain of its member countries, joint possessiO~ of
~ Utldear devices with power ofdecision being held on an equal foo!lng.
• ~ coP&idered this solution as the only one possible, given that Europe
hadnotyetreached a stage where it could speak with a s'n 1 ·
.&~.. u_ of h 1 g e votce, and such
Will ..ae 1111e t e present proposal for a multilateral fiorce hi b
e1fo h · w c represented
'1m rt, . owever mtperfect, .to utilize national potentials and enable all
the wuntrtes concerned, even if they had no nuclear potentt'al r th ·
• • • th · o etr own
flO pa.rttctpate m ell' own defence in this field. '
To make a choice in favour of a multilateral force was not, the speaker
~to~ t~ say, ~ easy matte~ since. the objection to "several fingers on the
tngger still remamed (and this applied to an Atlantic and a European force
a.li!'e, .so long ~ the. latter failed to delegate power to one person) but that
obJection applied still more cogently to a juxtaposition of national forces
with "several fingers on several triggers" and a consequent increase in the
dangers of an "accident". Again, the creation of a multilateral force would
enable the United States' partners to share America's experience in the man-
agement of such a force and the speaker expressed the hope that in these cir-
cumstances the various countries would not insist any longer on the possession
of a nuclear force.
A British participant analysed in similar terms the various possible formulas
for emerging from the present situation which he described as one dominated
by "psycho-pathological" elements: a critical lack of confidence on both
sides of the Atlantic, a profound anxiety resulting from the fact that the
Soviet capacity to retaliate to an American atomic attack would lessen the
credibility ofthe American deterrent.
Three possibilities wefe open to us:
- each ally to possess its own nuclear force: such a formula, said the speaker,
was irrational and a cause ofdivision within the Alliance;
- a multinational force from which each member could withdraw if need
be. This solution was likewise unacceptable since it involved discrimination
in favour of those members of the Alliance with a lead in the technical field
which, the speaker reminded his audience, included the me~ of delivery;
- a multilateral force but this would only be genuinely multilateral and re-
tain allits "credibility'' ifit excluded any possibility ofa United States veto.on
im use. This would not be easy in practice, if only because.su~~ .a concesston
'Would involve the danger ofincreasing the United States liabilities out of all
proportion to its interest in the joint defence of Europe.
'Phe best practical solution would therefore consist in giving the Europe~n
members greatersayin the use ofthe deterrent by in~reasin~ th~ knowledge m
thia ticdd and intensifyingjoint consultation. To achieve this, srud the speaker,

As a number of other participants had already emphasised, it was certain
that NATO must evolve. There had already been a considerable degr f
vol · · · ee o
e ~t1?n ~ce 1t was set up:. Greece and Turkey, followed by Germany,
had JOmed 1ts ranks. International problems which it was once considered
im~ble evc:n t~ touch on in ~e NATO Council were now the subject of
detailed exammation. Much remruned to be done and, in world affairs, mem-
bers would have to achieve a certain harmony if absolute solidarity proved
impossible. In this connexion, it was noteworthy that the machinery for con-
sultationwas gradually beingperfected. Inshort, repeated the speaker, NATO's
shortcomings should not be dramatized by being represented as utter in-
capacities.
This relative optimism was not shared by a Belgian participant, already
quoted several times, who recalled the recent American proposals to give a
worldwide character to consultation within NATO, to set up an atomic com-
mittee in NATO and, finally, to institute multilateral, multinational or inter-
allied nuclear forces. Such proposals, he contended, had been received by
Europe with hesitationand contradictory reactions. True, the proposals had
varied but the United States awaited a gesture from Europe indicating that
there was a readiness to accept them.
The European countries' great desire to be associated with nuclear strategy
(a desire which was met by the American proposal for a NATO force) and
theiranxiety to avoid being excluded from research concerning atomic ~ne~gy
and delivery systems were entirely legitimate but the methods ofsausfyin.g
such aspirations should be discussed within the framework of NAT? and 1t
was reasonable to fear that no such discussion would take place until agree-
ment was reached on the key principle of the indivisibility of ~ee ~or~d de-

A French p~rticipant who had occupied a high position in a previous French
government d~cussed the psychological and institutional aspects of the ro-
blems confrontmg the alliance, problems of "growth" involved · d · p
. . . m a apung to
ne'; . s1tuat1o~, sometimes complicated by the inertia with which certain
lcgttl~ate ~lru~s had long been received. In consequence, governments must
show unagtnatlOn.
For example, it was normal that 200 million Europeans should wish to take
part more effectively in the direction ofworld affairs and that America's allies
should v.rish to extend their research and their activity in the nuclear field since
the Atlantic Pact had never been described as implying an American nuclear
monopoly: France and England ·would never have accepted such an arrange-
ment. Atlantic institutions must accordingly be adapted to those aspirations.
Given the immense danger involved in the dissemination of atomic knowledge
and weapons, would not the United States, asked the speaker, show its leader-
ship in discussing ·with its allies ways of limiting that dissemination and of
adapting national programmes to the demands of the Alliance? In this con-
nexion, the present proposal for a multilateral force gave a certain impression
of improvisation which was not reassuring. A serious and considered analysis
in these fields would dispel many an.xieties and suspicions, even if no final
solution were immediately forthcoming. Naturally, an open-minded attitude
on the part of the United States in these fields should find its counterpart on
the other side of the Atlantic: Europeans should agree to carry a greater share
of the joint burden, including assistance to development, outside. ~ny form of
"European nationalism" and not in such a way that the amb1t10ns of any
c:ountry could be camouflaged undt:r the European label. .
It was for this reason, the speaker concluded, that the future of t~e t~lh~ce
required European integration combined withsufficiently developed wsotuoons
so that the nuclear powers of Europe would be, so to speak, t:'"ustees for tb~

~dent ~enn~dy's willin~ess and ability to implement the Atlantic
--- pu1it).ership which was the rum of the Trade Expansion Act·
~c extent of European interest in liberalization of trade with the United
-.trade in agricultural products, particularly those products which are
subject to the Community's variable import levy system·
- possible alternatives to an Atlantic trade partnership:
The no~e recalled that the United Kingdom's exclusion from the European
Conunumty rendered ineffective President Kennedy's authority under the
Trade Expansion Act to cut certain tariffs out completely. 1 The only re-
maining possibility was a so% reduction, a fact which reduced the American
Administration's negotiating possibilities and prospects. The essential purpose
of the Act was to achieve a genuine Atlantic trade partnership, thereby pre-
venting a division of the Western world into antagonistic blocs.
On this basis, the programme enjoyed broad national and congressional
support. In present circumstances, any substantial liberalization of trade with
the European Community seemed to Americans less valuable and less feasible.
It followed that approaches would be more cautious and matter-of-fact;
additionally, the Administration would be less centrally concerned with the
Community and more interested in Great Britain, Canada and possiblyJapan.
There was evidence ofa lack ofinterest on the part ofthe European Commu-
nity in dramatic tariff reductions. This might be explained by adjustments
which had already taken place between members of the Commun~ty and b!
ieJ.uctancetoinvitea neW wave Ofcompetition from powerful, aggreSSIVe Amen-
;e.Q. firms. There were also Europeans who saw such reductions as a threat to
\European integration. The Community could therefore be expected to ap-

These support pric~ woul~ th~~ore be a critical factor and the Community
had so far shown little dispo8ltion to be flexible on this point.
Great Britain had expressed great interest in the Kennedy ·Round all th
more so since Britain's exclusion from the Common Market had led tfutt coun~
try to look for other export opportunities. But the provisions ofboth the Trade
Expansion Act and the GATT would prohibit the United States from granting
tariffconcessions to Great Britain without also applying them to the Communi-
ty. Should negotiations with the Community prove unproductive, the advan-
tages of the Kennedy Round to Britain would be correspondingly small.
These concerns had led certain circles to suggest that the United States
should enter into a preferential trade liberalization arrangement with Britain,
other EFTA countries and Canada. But such an arrangement would be illegal
under the Trade Expansion Act -and would also violate the GATT unless
it took the form of a free trade area. Moreover, this formula would further
divide the Western Alliance and drive the Community towards protection-
ism. Spokesmen for the Community had frequently stressed that it was open
in nature. Only if the Community were to turn decisively away from that
policy would so radical a departure from the policy ofAtlantic trade partner-
ship be justified. At the present time, a policy of ?artnership was still the
best, though its implementation had become more difficult.
In the course of the discussion, a number of speakers referred to the failure
of the Brussels negotiations in January I g63, a subject already touched on
during the exchange ofviews concerning the first item ofthe agenda. A Nether-
lands participant and a British speaker emphasised the unexpectedness ofthat
failure the former quoting a passage from Professor Hallstein's_statement of

problems which were of a global nature and allowing for
coM.iUons of membership meant acceptance of an enormous ex-
peoilioa of the Common Market which pre-supposed major changes in the
Waaceofpowerand policy Within the Community itselfand the consequences
:ad saerifices involved on both sides had likewise to be accepted. On a more
t.mallevel, Bald the speaker, there were only a few pages ofprinciples embo-
died tn the Rome Treaty, the bulk ofwhich (especiallyin the annexedprotocols)
CODSisRdofwaivers ofthose principles in order to satisfy the legitimate concerns
~oneoranother ofthe member countries. It was therefore equally possible to do
likewise in respect of Great Britain without violating the spirit of the Treaty.
A similar point of view was expressed by another British participant who
outlined the attitude adopted by the British government in the Brussels negotia-
tions. He declined to admit that the failure could be attributed to the British
attitude and he pointed out that his country's requests did not go beyond the
provisions of the Treaty {article 237 of which provided for negotiation on the
conditions of membership for new members). On 14]anuary, agreement had
already been reached on a number of arrangements. It was the Common-
wealth preference system which was regarded by some as discriminatory but
it was precisely by succeeding in reconciling that consideration with the Rome
Treaty's provisions concerning certain underdeveloped countries that a move
might have been made towards a satisfactory solution ofdevelopment problems
at world level.
A French and a Netherlands speaker, both ofwhom favoured a satisfactory
arrangement with Great Britain, nonetheless emphasised the importance of
leaving the principles embodied in the Rome Tre~ty intact and, more espe-
cially, of continuing the integration process of which that Treaty was a be-
ginning. bl .

ar!seve~~=tem~n:~yAmerican participants revealed the extent to which the
e ure . a mtcn:cred with Washington's plans to strengthen the
Western wo~ld VIa econonuc measur:s. An American participant emphasised
how the Uruted ~tates government, m spite of the protectionist forces in the
country, had decrded after prolonged hesitation on a liberal 1' [

m conVIction ut also because 1t cons1dered lhis essential in th tru 1
. . . e s gge
a~amst commums~, m or~er to expand markets, assist underdeveloped coun-
tnes and, finally, m the mterest of the United States. Another American
speaker outlined the steps taken by his government since the war in order to
achiev.e close Atlantic co:-operati~n: he cited the Marshall Plan and the sup-
po~ gtven.to European mtegrat10n on a supranational basis and covering the
Umted Kingdom. Such a system would likewise protect the interests of the
smaller European countries and make co-operation >vith the United States
possible on an equal footing, the United States not being in a position to enter
a system ofunification such as was planned for Europe. Finally, there would be
no question of American "leadership", a term which called up the notion of
domination. The speaker remarked that the "Six" had made a considerable
contribution towards strengthening themselves individually and collectively
but that the attitude of the United Kingdom towards integration combined
with that country's exclusion from the Common Market as the result of the
nationalistic ambitions of a single state had precipitated the crisis, the
European partner having defaulted. The speakerstronglystressed his country's
desire to see Western Europe eventually form a greater unit, notwithstanding
the present setbacks, a unit which alone could enable the problems discussed
to-day to be settled on the basis of a genuine partnership.
In this connexion, an American participant furnished a number of chrono-
logical indications concerning the possible development of the ~ennedy
Round, making due allowance for the provisions ofthe Trade_ Rxpans10n ~ct.
The President would first have to publish a list of those arocles c?ncerrung
which he intended to negotiate. The TariffCommission would have s~"< months
following such publication in which to hear from all interested partle~ and ~0

Another American speaker, however, pointed out that consideration must
be given to the climate prevailing within the United States when the Trade
Expansion Act entered into force. The protectionist elements had declined
and many businessmen had become extremely liberal but there was still
persistent unemployment, which might be structural, in certain areas. It
followed that a lowering of customs barriers which would increase that unem-
ployment without increasing exports would be badly received. If, in addition,
a foreign government were to adopt public positions of a somewhat arbitrary
nature towards American proposals, not only would the task confronting Mr.
Herter, the negotiator appointed by the President, which was already crush-
ing, be made even heavier, but the protectionist faction in Congress might
even bring about amendments to the Act. A British participant alluded to a
certain bitterness in his country following on events in Brussels which had
occasioned an increase in nationalism calculated to have an unfavourable
influence on his country's position vis-a-vis the negotiations contemplated by
President Kennedy.
Among the specific problems raised by the Kennedy Round and the E.E.C.
policy, a number of speakers referred to the qu~stion of ag~cultural products
and all of them recognized that it was of a particularly delicate na~re.
Particular attention was paid to the insistence-which, acco~ding to the
press, was the responsibility of the French govern~ent-on making an:m~e­

mdus~es (e.g. m the realm ofspace research) by the massive orders placed by
the Umted S~tes go_:erz:ment, whereas there was no corresponding support
for ~~ same mdustnes 1n Europe. This point was also made by a Belgian
partiopant.
. - The unevennes~ of American tariffs, some of which reached extremely
high rates, much higher than those of the Common Market. This was the
c.ause of the demand.for a lowering of the level of such tariffs before negotia-
tiOns began on equality of reductions to be granted by both sides.
In this regard, a Belgian participant suggested that recourse be had to
certain techniques already employed by OEEC which aimed at avoiding
purely national protective clauses or, at any rate, that certain rules be created
to govern their application, on the recommendation of special committees
set up for the purpose. Even ifthe Kennedy Round succeeded, it was impor-
tant not to rest content with that since, as the French speaker had emphasised,
protectionism could re-emerge in a thousand forms.
Whether in connexion with agricultural questions, non-tariff barriers or
any other problem, the negotiation ofthe Kennedy Round would be facilitated
if it were possible for the European Community "to speak with one voice".
The R ome Treaty provided that up to I J anuary rg66 decisions concerning
the trade treaties must be reached unanimously by the six contracting parties.
Mter that date, which marked the end of the transition period, a specific
majority would be sufficient. Considerable interest was therefore aroused by
the suggestion of an international participant that the date should ?e brought
forward to I J anuary I g65, the year I g64 being devoted to a tec~cal.s~vcy
ofthe various elements involved in the negotiations. Possibly, this p~rttCipant

In the course of the discussion, a number of speakers dwelt on th 1 b 1
ture fth bl " · egoa
na o e pro ems reqmnng solutJ.on, the approaches to be adopted and
the goals to ~e reached as well as on the importance ofthe attitude taken by the
general public towards the new choices to be made.
As a British participant emphasised, it was a question ofimproving the trade
structure throughout the whole free world. It was essential, therefore, as of
now, that the European Community, Great Britain and the United States
should av?id any steps calculated to endanger subsequent negotiations. It
was essennal to combat any signs ofprotectionism which were often the econo-
mic reflection of a rebirth of nationalism. This attitude should take concrete
form, suggested a Netherlands participant, through the adoption of a joint
code ofgood behaviour in regard to international trade which would formally
reject subsidies, dumping, cartels, etc. :Moreover, as a French, an Italian and
a Netherlands participant emphasised, joint lines ofaction should be laid down,
whether it was a question of agricultural products, assistance to underdevel-
oped countries, financial conditions ensuring a balanced expansion or a num-
ber of other fields.
Another English speaker stated that he agreed unreservecUy with the solu-
tions recommended by his compatriot but he pointed out that, in order to
reach the goals set, adequate impetus was required and bilateral discussions
must take place with the members of the Common Market in order to reach
a final multilateral arrangement with its members. That was what the British
government sought but it was obviously up to the members of the Common
Market to decide.
All this implied however, not only new institutions and a new distribution
ofthe burden but:USO perhaps a new outlook, a new way ofthinkingin terms of
association, in short a profound alteration in men's minds. Such a change
could not take place overnight and this was likewise stressed by a numbe~ of
other participants who, on the whole, showed cautious optimi~m c~uce~g
the future. There would certainly be several "rounds", someu~es 1~volvmg
sharp discussions before final success was achieved. The essential thing was
to overcome pre;ent bitterness, however legitimate, and not.to represent the
difficulties which would inevitably arise as so many final failures.

III. TRADE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE WESTERN WORLD
AND THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (TARIFFS,
QUOTAS, COMMODITY ARRl\.NGEMENTS, ETC.)
Prior to discussion of this point, all participants had received a questionnaire
specially drawn up for the meeting by an Indian rapporteur, as well as a note
prepared by a German participant on the basis of this questionnaire.
The Indian questionnaire comprised the following main headings and
questions:
.6.,.. THE IMPORTANCE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE LESS-DEVELOPED COUNT-
lUES TO THE MAINTENA..~CE OF HIGH LEVELS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN THE
INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES.
I) What are the categories of goods on which the increase in developing
countries' import requirements will be concentrated?
2) What repercussions is this increase in requirements likely to have on
industrial production in the highly industrialized countries?
B. HOW CAN LESS-DEVELOPED COUNTRIES BE ASSISTED TO MEET THEIR IMPORT
REQUIREMENTS?
Through what means can less-developed countries be helped to finance
these growing requirements? What role should be assigned: .
a) to an increase in earnings of the less-developed countries from their
exports?
b) to long-term financial assistance or credits?
c) to private foreign investment?
d) to outright transfers and grants?

3) What importan~e can be attached to diversification of exports from
less-develop.ed countnes and what are the possibilities for such countries to

4) What are the ~elds in_ which highly industrialized countries can meet
a larger part _of thexr. reqw_

expect wide outlets and what can be done in this direction?
5) Can the less-de~c~opcd countries be encouraged to meet their require-

highly industrialized countries?
6) How can the barriers to imports of processed and semi-processed goods
from the less-developed countries be reduced?

in one of the less-developed countries is not in a position to compete on a
completely equal basis with the corresponding production in the highly in-

It was to this questionnaire that the note drawn up by a Germa~ partici-
. h this t called the differences
pant referred In a prelimmary paragrap , no e re . .
pf ~.inionwhlch exist as to the most effective methods ofacc~eratmg econonnc
~m.ent and, more especially, as to which forms of ass1Stance should be
37
given priority. Some em~hasise the provision ofcapital, others stress increased
trade. It ~ould seem, satd the author of the note, that technical assistance is
the most rmportant form of development aid in that it creates th · ·
di . r. • e requxslte
con nons .~.or rational employment of capital as well as intensification of ex-
ports. Other meas~res may prove ineffective unless the countries receiving aid
possess people tr~ned to make the maximum use thereof. Only a balanced
development polic!, moreover, ca~ contribute to the solution of the gigantic
problems confronting those countries and no such policy can succeed unless
supported by those countries' own efforts and determination.
The author ofthe note went on to develop a certain number ofconsiderations
embodied in I o paragraphs:
I. Without increased trade political assistance, the debts of the developing
countries will continue to increase so that in the foreseeable future they will
either no longer be able to meet their credit obligations or will be forced to
cut down their imports thereby making progress impossible. For many of the
developing countries which already use 15% of their income for the payment
of creditdebts, the time when the situation will become critical is not very far
away. This dilemma can only be overcome by a series ofco-ordinated measures:
increased exports, productive use of credit, technical assistance directed to
specific projects and increased use ofprivate capital. Hence the importance of
the outlets made available to these countries.
2. It is not easy to answer the question raised as to the importance which
trade with developing countries represents for the industrialized countries
because ofthe different conditions in which the latter find themselves. General-
ly speaking, the production of industrial plants, equipment ~d machines will
be stimulated. As regards consumer goods, the demand will o~y gradu~y
increase. In order to avoid inflationary tension in the developmg co~tnes,
however, steps should be taken forthwith to provide for adequate supplies of
everyday utility goods. .
3· Opinions differ as to the effectiveness of raw matenal agree~ents as a
means ofraising the export yield ofdeveloping countries. It is certam ~at ~e
best support for raw material prices is provided by good business conditions u;.
the purchasing countries. The developing countries can rely on t?esupport:e

more acceptable to public opm10n m the donor countries but also in the re-
cipientcountries because ofthe political dependence which may be involved in
certain gifts. In this connexion, the intermediary solutions applied by I.D.A.
are of considerable interest.
9· Fundamentally, the countries providing the funds consider that they have
not only the right but even a duty to watch over the use made oftheir aid and
this perhaps explains why such aid is more often granted for a specific project
rather than contributed to the national budgets. This is a sound principle, in
the opinion of the author of the note who also eA-pressed himself as being in
favour oflinking aid to purchases in the donor country: there is no reason, he
wrote, why it should not be stated that aid is a contribution to establishing
and strengthening lasting trade relations with the receiving country, thus
strengtheningthetrade situationinthe donor country. Moreover, the industrial
countries have virtually no alternative since the biggest donor country, i.e. the
U.S.A., has been concluding such tied contracts for a considerable time past.
10. A number of difficulties and tensions have arisen from the very under-
standable desire ofthe developing countries to complete their economic build-
up within very short time limits. Such a process calls for com~ined efforts.by
the government, the administration and the native and foreign econonues,
and the conditions required for such co-operation have in many cases not ~een
achieved. It is therefore desirable that these countries should allow suffioent
scope for the dynamics of free enterprise, especially where ~ere is already a
broad layer oflocal enterprises, so that the initiative of those m ch~rge ofsuch
~ will provide a stimulus which may be vital to econouuc progress.

peel y, an ~encan participant referred to the report recently drawn
up by Gen~al Cl~y m order to stress that the conditions imposed by his gov-
ernment on 1ts asststance would henceforward be much stricter and the volume
ofsuch aid restricted. As a British participant observed, it is undeniable that
leaders in the receiving countries are sometimes corrupt or venal and incapable
ofadvancing the welfare oftheir people. Others, as pointed out by an American
and a Swiss participant, withdraw into a species of immobilism by relying on
the aid granted them (especially when such aid is of a humanitarian nature)
or. alternatively, reveal themselves incapable of planning their long-term
development, as was underlined by another American participant who stated
that he himselfhad more confidence in widely decentralized local bodies than
in governmental institutions. Additionally, as pointed out by a Norwegian
and a French participant, several governments show themselves more con-
cerned with incurring expenditure for prestige purposes (e.g. setting up
unprofitable national air-lines) than with investments aimed at effecting a ra-
pid improvement in living standards. Finally, there is a psychological diffi-
culty in addition to the other difficulties mentioned above when, as an Ameri-
can and a British participant reminded the meeting, governments in receipt
ofaid give financial support in another quarter to action directly or indirectly
opposed to the policy ofthe donor countries.
A participant belonging to an international organiza~on furthe: :emarked
that it was often very difficult to find "valid spokesmen" m the re~e1vmg coun-
tries since there were only a limited number of such spokemen, w1th the result
that it could prove necessary to abandon certain projects for this reason a~o~c:
hence the necessity (which was stressed by a number ~f ~pe~ers) fo: ~vm~
absolute priority to the economic, finan:cial and .admmJstra~ve tr~~g~t
local officials and business people. In thiS connex1on, an Italian partlClp.
stated that it was essential to draw up an overall plan in each country which
grouped the public and private sectors and which gave pr~ference to ed:a~
tion within the country concerned rather than to the allocation of scholars P
for study abroad. Similarly, an American participant contended th~:oe:

--~in support of thell' Vl~w that, while fully recognizing the various
~, a.~eater share of~SlStan_ce should be devoted to giving instruction
morpopul~theuse ofvanous brrth-control and family-planning methods.
A Ftench pattiapant also voiced the opinion that the migration of nationals
&om the poor countries of Asia, Mrica and elsewhere towards other conti-
nents could not provide a solution because of the social, moral, religious and
health difficulties involved for those concerned.
Relatively few speakers committed themselves on the respective importance
ofaid provided from public and private funds but all agreed on the need to
enable developing countries to build up an economic potential which would
provide continually increasing foreign currency earnings simultaneously
with an expansion oflocal consumption. An Italian speaker listed the following
four forms of assistance in order ofpriority: r) technical assistance; 2) econo-
mic aid; 3) trade facilities; 4) private capital. At the same time, however,
as a French and a British participant pointed out, increased trade cannot be
regarded as a substitute for assistance (ifonly because exports are drawn from
the oountry's resources) but as an essential complement to such aid, a comple-
mentwhich, according to the British speaker, must become increasingly impor-
tant with the passage of time.
An important discussion took place concerning the question of aid tied to
p'lttchases in the countries supplying funds, some participants not wholly
Jharing the German rapporteur's favourable view ofthis fo:~ula. One ~peaker
:reminded the meeting that the result as far as the recetvmg countn.es was
~ed frequently took the form of an increase in the cost of th~ pur-
~' amounting to as much as 20% for certain products according to
:O~.CJ). caJ.culations. This point was also stressed by a French speaker. Some
~ au<ili as the United States, which have real balance of payments
~can justify tied assistance; others seek to justify it_by reference. to

governing the allocation of loans should, however, be jointly adopted, in the
~pinion of~ ~;enc~ participant, ifonlyto avoid a sort ofcompetition, a "dump-
mg ofcredits , which would encourage certain useless investments and lead to
a dangerous degree ofindebtedness.
The importance of the role which foreign private capital can play in invest-
ments in developing countries was recognised by most of ilie speakers. Iflocal
conditions are such as to encourage national enterprises, said an American
participant, the same holds true for foreign investors, on condition that they
are not made the subject of discriminatory laws as has happened in certain
countries (e.g. in Brazil as regards the oil industry). The same speaker consider-
ed that at least in Latin America, private foreign investments were much
greater than the balance of payments of ilie countries concerned would lead
one to suppose. Against this, a British participant contended, on the basis of
his own country's financial contributions, that world prospects were not fa-
vourable to private investment, more especially because of the poor prospects
for profits which tl1e developing countries afforded. . .
As might have been expected, the question ofguarantees to foreign mvestors
was raised by several participants who referred, mo~e particularly , to ilie .In-

In this connex.ion, a number of participants raised the question of "terms
of trade", in other words the relationship between the prices of raw materials
from developing countries and the prices of the industrial goods which they
are obliged to purchase from the industrialized countries. The Indian author
of the questionnaire distributed to participants indicated that the former had
constantly fallen over recent years. This view was challenged by several par-
ticipants. In actual fact, one of them contended, such deterioration was not
especially evident ifone took a long-term view. In 1950·1952 (a period which
was often taken as a reference) there had been an abnormal rise in prices
because of the boom occasioned by the Korean war; in subsequent years, on
the other hand, the liquidation of stocks established at that time had had a
markedly :depressive effect on prices. But-and this was rec~gnized ~y all ~e
speakers-it would be more accurate to say that it w.as the p~ces for mdustnal
goods which had steadily risen over the same penod. Van~us factors ~:re

d . th dis . A ns
W:Ug e ~usston. French speaker referred to it in recommending rules
which he cons1dered should govern the opening of Western markets to such
products: in the first place, the markets would have to be opened by the va-
rious Western countries in concert. In this way, the developing countries'
exports would be spread out over wider markets whereas, if a single country
were to open its market, the violent repercussions on its industries would have
a psychological effect running counter to the aim sought. In the second place,
such action should be gradual in order to leave the threatened industries suffi-
cient time to reconvert. On a purely practical level, the most favoured nation
clause should be applied in favour of the developing countries without
hypocritical loop-holes such as limiting the reduction of tariffs for products
which those countries supply on a large scale and the industrialized countries
might waive reciprocal application of the clause. On the other hand, the de-
veloping countries themselves would have to agree to limit their exports so as
to avoid disturbances in the importing countries and certain recent cases
demonstrate that such voluntary limitation is not impossible. A British par-
ticipant regretted that trade between the developing countries themselves was
not increasing as rapidly as the rest of world trade and reco~m~ded _
that,
in addition, the practice ofquotas should be dropped wherever It still perSisted.
An American participant observed that it was essential to combat the ~a.ra­
doxical tendency of citizens in the industrialized countries to favour provlSlon
ofaid from public funds-which they, as tax-payers, financed-rather than the
opening of markets which represented less of a burden on the tax-pay~r but
the effects of which were undoubtedly more apparent (and more difficult
to handle since they occur in such branches as the textile industry where large
numbers are employed and research budgets limited)· . .

by several speakers ~d, more p~rticula:ly~ by an Italian participant who
pointed out that the m~erest of this assoc1at1on lay mainly in its equality as~
pectwhich enabled African leaders to be associated with the decisions taken.
This idea was taken up by a British speaker who emphasised that the first
'Cil!Seiltial was to deal with questions ofaid and trade alike through the medium
orinstitutions which gave the developing countries the feeling that their in-
terests were beingprotected and their problems dealt with from their own point
:Qfview.
In the course of the various statements, the necessity for an everincreasing
co-ordination ofthe aid given developing countries by the industrialized conn-
tires was emphasised by a number of speakers and would seem to have been
generally recognised. Any "cacophony" in this field, said an American parti-
cipant, must be carefully avoided and this opinion was echoed by an I talian
participant. An Italian participant likewise reminded the meeting that the
steps taken should lead to an organization on a basis of equality which would
seek to settle the developing nations' problems on a world-wide level, if need
be receiving delegations of sovereignty. Whatever the institutional framework
chosen, however, it is essential, as a French delegate emphasised towards the
end ofthe discussion that the Western countries should agree within the con-
text ofsuch co-operation to share the financial burdens and the responsibilities.

Before declaring the meeting closed, H .R.H. the Prince of the Netherlands
extended the assembly)s warmest thanks to its French hosts and to the various
ntembers ofthe Secretariat and then went on to outline some ofthe impressions
to be derived from the three days of discussions.
It would seem he said that the solutions recommended by the various
' '
tpeakers for the problems involved were unlikely to be unreservedly accepta-
ble to all participants. No satisfactory solution had been found to the most
i;lportant issues which was not a tragedy so long as we were agreed on the
~principles. It was true that the confusion reigning ever since r4]anuary
~t seem disquieting and discouraging but the West could not allow such
~to continue. In regard to nuclear problems, a way would.have to ?e

·•ltWU<llnlr 1tem II ofthe Agenda it was clear that the Brussels set-back was
fa:..~Mb.P,toJn of a crisis within the Alliance and not its cause. There would
to be certain weaknesses in our ability to define an equal partnership
~~lttiin the Atlantic framework. Perhaps there had been a tendency to talk
about this. One of our tasks should be to show ourselves more
trmetii~e regarding this partnership and to try and define our objectives in the
fOJitical, economic and military spheres.
It would not seem, unfortunately, that Great Britain's entry into the Com-
mon Market was imminent. But what happened within the E.E.C. would be
«.crucial importance, not only for the members themselves but also for their

European friends believed in the permanence of their policy towards
