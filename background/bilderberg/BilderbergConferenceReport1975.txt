INTRODUCTION
The twenty-fourth Bilderberg Meeting was held at the Golden Dolphin
Hotel, Cesme, Turkey, on 25, 26 and 27 April, 1975, under the Chairmanship
of H.R.H. The Prince of the Netherlands.
There were 99 participants, who came from 14 European countries, the
United States, Canada and several international organizations. A wide variety
of fields was represented: government and politics, banking, education, the
law, journalism, industrial management and trade unions, transport, foun-
dation administration, and the diplomatic service.
In accordance with the rules adopted at each Meeting, all participants spoke
in a purely personal capacity without in any way committing the organization
or government to which they belonged. To enable participants to speak
frankly, the discussions were confidential, with no press reporters admitted.
The Agenda was as follows:
I. Inflation: Its Economic, Social and Political Implications.
II. Recent International Political Developments:
A. The present status and prospects of efforts to resolve the Arab-Israeli
conflict, and the effect on relations among NATO members.
B. Other recent developments affecting the relations among NATO
countries.
In opening the meeting, H.R.H. The Prince of the Netherlands read ~he
text of a telegram which he had sent to the President of Turkey, expressmg
gratitude for that country's hospitable welcome. (A message of good w~shes
from President Korutlirk was read to the participants at a subsequent sesswn.)
· f · · d from the Turkish Prime
The Pnnce also read a telegram o greetmgs receive
Minister, Mr. Demirel.
Mter recalling the rules of procedure, the Prince turned to the first item
on the Agenda.

ITEM I
INFLATION: ITS ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND
POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS
WORKING PAPERS
Th_e background for the discussion of this subject was provided by three
working p~pers - prepar~d ?Y a Canadian, a German and a Dutch partici-
pant- wh1ch had been d1stnbuted to the participants prior to the conference.
A. The Canadian paper was entitled "Inflation, 1950-75: A Social and Politi-
cal Perspective". According to the author, the present hyperinflation and
severe recession are inextricably linked. Our current predicament marks a
pronounced break in the surge of economic growth experienced in the advanced
Western industrial countries over the last 25 years. How have the goals and
policies of the past quarter century brought us to this pass? Clearly there has
been a persistent inflationary bias; the dangers of inflation have been down-
graded in relation to the priorities of previous history, and the consequences
of inflation subordinated to other social and political purposes.
Mindful of the Great Depression, and inspired by wartime sacrifices, govern-
ments after World War II took a quantum jump in explicitly accepting un-
precedented responsibilities for full employment, the general welfare and
greater equality. The resolution of governments to assume these far-reaching
social goals was fortified by the new orthodoxy of the "Keynesian Revolution",
which swept aside critical perspective and balanced foresight.
The new doctrines sought to show that the capitalist market system in
advanced industrialized countries tended inherently toward chronic stagnation,
and could not ensure the full use of resources (including labor). The Keynesian
solution was for government to manage total aggregate demand so as to brin_g
into use all productive resources and thus guarantee full employr:nent. This
demand management was to be accomplished by timely changes m govern-
mental revenues and spending, facilitated by discretionary management o_f the
money and credit system to maintain low interest rates and ample supphe~ of
credit. These policies were aimed at encouraging both ~ggregate consumptw~
and private investment, which were held to be closely hnked through a multi-
plier relationship.

thought that the main role of money was to kn·p inlt·r-.-sr r.ttn I"''·· and rh.lt
its supply could be regulated for this purpose- without rnuch ~rg.ard for dfrct.s

The new orthodoxy also assumed reasonable accuracy of d. .
. . me 1um-term
economiC forecast~ng. In fact, official forecasts used for fiscal purposes have
very often been Wide of the mark, so that government action or inaction has
been wrong or untimely. In the face of these difficulties, better results were
sought through "fine tuning" based on short-range information. Unfortunate!
there are long and \·ariable lags between fiscal and monetary decisions a:d
their effects on the economy. Furthermore, tactics aimed at quick results and
the attainment of short-run inflation/unemployment trade-offs tend to be
frustrated by the public's inflationary expectations.
In short, the problems of achieving full employment and general welfare
and security on a sustained basis have turned out to be far more complex
than the new postwar economic doctrines had envisaged. The hopes that
government could effectively manage aggregate demand and money have been
proven simplistic and exaggerated.
Perhaps the most significant outcome of the Keynesian Revolution has been
the unprecendented growth of goYCrnment in the West over the past quarter
century. Total gO\·ernment spending as a percentage of GNP has approxi-
mately doublrd, and continues to rise in many countries toward the 50 per cent
level. More and more economic and social decisions are being made in the
political and bureaucratic arena, with automatic market processes playing a
diminishing role. Governments everywhere are confronted with pressure
groups whose demands cannot be reconciled with the means at hand. To cope
with this predicament, goH·rnments tend to avoid the hard decisions and to
resort to the inflation of the money system - social and political peace being
given precedence owr equity and efficiency.
Throughout the postwar period, the monetary authorities have generally
accommodated the political realities by making available supplies of money an~
credit. The inflationary process eased the government's prob~ems of d.efiot
financing while enabling it to increase its revenues without havmg to legislate
unpopular taxes. f
The political importance of the short run is a most troublesome feature

In his introductory remarks, the author emphasizrd the J){'rnicious ps~-rho­
logical effect of generalized inflationary expect;ttions. For nr.ulv t\'1.-o crnlurirs,
price levels had been relatiH·Iy stabk, apart from aberrations c;uasnl h~- wars
and revolutions. But since the Second \\'orld \\'ar, prrsiqentlv risin~t priers
had come to be considered "normal", as we had rrsorted In discrrtinnal)·
monetary and fiscal policies in an attempt to achirve .1mhitinu!l !'<leial .1nd
political goals. The resulting inflationary prl'ssurl's had bern intensified rrcrntly
by the vastly increased cost of food and raw materials rsrwci.11Jv enrrJtr·:, a
phenomenon which had been accommodated hy a ~rnrral prier rise imtrad of
by the traditional relative price changes.
After each period of economic expansion, we had moved onto .1 nrw and
higher platform of inflation, since thl' excrcisl' of discrrtinn<~rY policies would
work only within the context of constantly rising priers. :\s it ll('c.1mr more
and more difficult to maintain order in our econornirs, thr risk '"'·15 th.11 wr
would be tempted into interventionist measures which would comprnmisr thr
fundamental character of our liberal democratic svstrm. Thr author thrrrforr
called for a re-examination of the validity of disc~etionary controls. :\light it
not be better, as the monetarists argued, to return to somr kind of <'Xtrrnalh··
imposed criteria to assure the orderly devclopmrnt of our money supply? .

B. The German author, addressing himself to the "Int t" 1 A
erna wna spects of
Inflation", o~ered _a set of fundamental facts, hypotheses and questions:
(r) Open m~atwn has been a persistent phenomenon in the free world
econo~y ever smce \Vorld _\Var II, ~n contrast to the interwar period, when
recessiOns brought ~bout ~nee reduc_twns. Is this open (or suppressed) inflation
a means of preventmg senous recessiOns, and thus over the long run of raising
the average rate of _employment, capacity utilization and potential growth?
If so, why should this be, and are there not alternate ways of attaining pros-
perity?
(2) ~hi~e in~ustrialized nations have only gradually moved from creeping
to trottmg mflat10n, the phenomenon of trotting or galloping inflation has long
been known in the less-developed countries. Is the fundamental cause never-
theless the same in both places, namely the political impossibility of raising
enough money in taxes and the consequent resort to the printing press, or the
"inflation tax"?
(3) Historical events suggest a positive answer to the above question: the
demand pressure in the lJS resulting from the Vietnam war; consequent
reduction in American unemployment; worsening of the US balance on cur-
rent account, reflecting overvaluation of the dollar; large capital outflows;
increased holdings of dollars and other foreign exchange reserves by foreign
central banks; and, at the same time, acceleration of inflation in all industri-
alized countries (except France) in the second half of the rg6o's.
(4) The subsequent devaluation of the dollar reflected (a) the unwillingness
of America's partners to continue paying this "inflation tax", and (b) the
unwillingness of American producers to suffer the competitive disadvantages
of an overvalued currency.
(5) America's trading partners were willing to pay the "inflati~n tax". for
as long as they did precisely because their exporters enjoyed competmg a_gamst
an overvalued dollar. Their consumers, small savers, and many economists, of
course, were on the other side of the fence.
(6) The worsening of the US trade balance was related to other develop-
ments: the implant;tion of US subsidiaries in Europe, where labor was then
relatively cheaper· the transfer of American know-how and teehnolo~ to
' · I · · · d Amencan
Europe, depriving the US of part of Its monopo Y positiOn' an
preoccupation with producing for the Vietman war and the space program..
(7) World inflation was probably also fueled by the creation ~f Spe~Ial
D

rawmg Rights JUSt at the time w en t e supp Y
sharply as a result of the US payments deficits.
(8) The doubling of world monetary reserves between rg6g and I973 was

workers from low wage countries, for these reasons· (a) such w k
. , . or ers are
usually ch~nnelled mto c?mplementary jobs in the lower strata, and are not
really considered competitors of domestic workers; (b) foreign workers com-
plement domestic capital equipment, and their presence helps to defend
traditional profit margins and to put a brake on the rise of labor costs and
prices; and (c) many European trade unions are less interested than their
American counterparts in maximizing real wages, and may be more concerned
with maximizing union membership for its own sake or for political reasons.
In short, this looks like a \\Til-designed mercantilist policy, designed to serve
t~e interests of producers and sellers -in contrast to consumers - and of politi-
Cians.
(15) Immigration is often an inferior alternative to imports of labor-
intensi\"C products from low-wage countries. \Yorld economic development
would benefit from increased transfers of capital, technology, know-how
and management skill to low-wage countries. (If it seems paradoxical that
this would tend to produce higher employment and more price level stability
at home, it should be remembered that the intermediate target is more sellers'
competition, that is, an impro\-ement in that odd system ofsocial control which
compels participants to sen-e ends which they do not, and need not, accept as
their objectin·s.)
(16) Inflation is sometimes related to the struggle over income distribution,
and it is possible that the rclatiH scarcity of labor in advanced countries has
become a factor contri huti ng to world inflation. If so, everything possible
should be done to keep business firms informed of structural changes and to
facilitate their quick adjustment.
Based on the foregoing analysis, the author makes these policy proposals: .
(1) Let monetary policy he concentrated on the single goal of supplY_mg
just as much money as is needed for the public to absorb the goods and ser~Ic~s
at prices consistent with a constant consumer price level. (Whether thi~ IS
achieved by a price In-c! rule or a quantity of money rule is of secondary Im-
portance.)

In introducing his paper, the author undrrlinrd crrt;tin C'nnlr~vrni.~l poi_nls
about inflationary causes, remedies and prospects. :\nv cli.ll;!flMI~ of 1nff.luon
had to take account of historical or episodic camr~. hut thrrr w.u .1nothrr
factor that should not be overlooked. In the postwar prrirxl, •• vrritahlr com-
petition had developed in democratic societies in prescrihin!{ the new Kf1·nn-
ian "medicine" of unexpected inflation. But it was only in thr initi.1l JX'flod,
when the "money illusion" had not yet been fullv rxploitrd, th.11 infbtion
could raise levels of employment above normal ratrs. So a C'nntinuin~ .Kcrlrra·
tion ofinflation was needed, which was what had lrd us from thr "nerping"to
the "galloping" stage.
As to remedies, the author was opposed on idrolo~ictl as wrll .u pr.1nical
grounds to direct controls, which had proved less cfkni\T than non·.ltllhori·
tarian measures. He favored instead a program aimrd at C'nrrrnin~ strunm.'ll
defects in three ways: (a) facilitating the procrss of ecnnnrnic .'ldjustmrnl h~·
improving the flow of information to the market; :hl innr.Hin~ C'OillJX'fition
by stepping up productive inwstment in low-wagr countrirs; ;md c \ .lll..'i~ning
to central banks the sole role of defending prier lrvrl stahilitv.
The immediate prospect was that the worldwidr slump was producin~ a
flattening of inflation during 1975, but that the rxpeC'ted ups,,.·ing of I!)j6-i7
could provoke a new wave of inflation in 1978, unlrss cntantrr-tnrilsurrs wrre
undertaken in time. So long as there was uncrrtainty about the futurr counc
ofinflation, capital markets would remain oriented toward thr short t<'rm. This
was bound to have a depressive effect on international trade and im·<'slm<'nl,
as had been the case in the inter-war years.

C. The Dutch paper dealt with "Inflation and its Impact on S · t " Th
· fl · ocie y . e
author defines m at10n as "a persistent and more or less substantial d 1· ·
f
, ecinein
th~ value o money, as measured by changes in price levels. Money serves as a
urut of account and as a means of payment. In an extremely inflationar
environment, the unit of account f~nction is eroded first; in a subsequent stag~
even ~e means-of-paymen~ funct10~ may. waste away. Although in theory
money IS a neutral and efficient lubncant, m practice it may become an inde-
pendent source of disturbances, of which inflation is the most important.
In a neutral situation, the flow of money is not unlike the blood circulation
in the human body - an uninterrupted process of distribution and collecti~n.
Nowhere is additional money pumped in or siphoned off, the amount in cir-
culation being just sufficient to maintain production and consumption at the
prevailing price level. New money is injected only in response to increases in
productivity or in the size of the labor force.
If more money than that is injected, inflationary disturbances will occur.
This phenomenon usually has its source in one or more of these circumstances:
(a) the business community, wanting to invest more than available savings'
turns to money-creating banks; (b) governments, unable to cover their budgets
by taxation and long-term borrowing, resort to money creation by the commer-
cial or central banks; (c) a rise in wage levels exceeds productivity increases
(cost-push inflation).
Whatever the cause of these sets of circumstances, they cannot arise or be
maintained without a growing flow of money. In this sense, inflation in all
its variations is a monetary phenomenon, and therefore could always be
prevented by a restrictive monetary policy. Whether such a policy is always
politically feasible is another question. .
To the above three situations - which assume for simplicity of analysis a
closed economy- a fourth may be added when taking into account internation-
al relationships: price increases of imported raw materials: I~ is not cle~r,
though, that this is really an independent factor. The sharp nse m commodity
prices in 1973 coincided with expansionary policies pursued ~o combat the
recession of 1970-71 (a textbook example of deman~-pull ~nflatiOn). The su?-
sequent rise in crude oil prices was a clear case of pnce-settm~ by a .monopolist

("st~gflation"), it mus~ be_ accompanied ~y policies deliberately designed to
de~nv_e wage and pnce mcreases _of the1r cumulative effects. The general
?mdehne should b~ t~at tl~e nommal .":age increase deflated by the price
mcrease should be m hne w1th product1v1ty growth (adjusted if necessary for
changes in the terms of trade).
This aim should preferably be achieved by a program of voluntary, non-
statutory. restraint, but where inflation has progressed deep into Stage Three,
only a ngorous wage and price freeze can provide the necessary breathing
space.
In many of our countries today, inflation is accompanied by widespread
structural unemployment as well as a classical downturn in the trade cycle.
A \·cry careful mix of monetary and fiscal policies is thus needed to stimulate the
economy while braking inflation. Fiscal stimulation will increase budgetary
deficits, but the go,·ernment's increased requirements must be met
by capital market borrowing and not by money creation. This is particularly
important in the CS, as an excess of money creation there would be bad not
only for the American economy but, because of the strategic importance of the
dollar, for the rest of the world as well.
Admittedlv the timclv and effective use of these economic and financial
', .
policies depends on political practicalities. \Vhat is relatively easy in the
first stage of inflation requires a nearly superhuman effort in Zone Three. So
we need political lt'adership that is able and prepared to convince the popu-
lation that, howt'wr high tlw cost of combating inflation, the cost of not
doing so will be nTn higher. The ultimate cost of failure will be the death of
the principles ofpri,·ate enterprise and democratic government.

Although there was now widrsprr;uf concern .1hour inff.1tion, N"CJnom~IS
and publicists had so far not donr a nry thorough joh ofarloll~7inK its dam.1gmg
and disorganizing effects. An Anwrican srwakrr found the rnc-.u{'h rffCJrt to
assemble the empirical fitets "astonishingly thin". .-\ comp.1triot thou!(ht that
the recent double-digit experiencr should srrn to underlinr thr d"trurth·e
impact of inflation, which had lwrrtofilrT hrrn in.ldequ.tteh- drmorutratf'd. A
few thoughtful people had bren apprchrnsin· ye.us .1go, hr ~1id. about the
prospective effect over two grnrrations of an annu.1l in0.1tion r<~te of two to
three per cent. Today everyone could apprrci.11e how .1 20 rx-r erne r<~tr would
virtually wipe out values in the space of a few ~Tars.
An International participant agrrcd that thr apJX'.U.lnce of douhlr-digit
inflation should make economists rralizr th;tt a cornpreheraivr nr,,· an.1I)'Sis of
the phenomenon was needecd. For too long, many of them h.1d agrrrd that we
should "learn to live with inflation", '"'·hilr indulging in fractiou~ audrmic
disputes with their fellows about causrs and rrrn~di~s. It now srrmrd clrar
that sharply accelerating inflation rates were not dur simply to a ('oincidrnce
offorces, but were the result of an international svnchronization dfr<"t.
Until very r~cently, though, the political and s~ial implic;uions of inffation
had been considered rather diffused, and it had not bern dr<lr rhat am· one
group was being p~rticularly hurt. The business community frh r<'aso~ably
~ell protecte_d, as did the trade unions, who feared that their goal of full rm-
p ~yment might be endangered by a serious anti-inflation polic,·. Thf'Se
attitudes had changed substantially with the arrival of "galloping" inflation.

. B. Effec~s on ~ndustry, trade and investment. A British participant described the
1mpact o~ mfl~t10n as see~ ac:oss an industrial operation. This had nothing to
do, he s~1d, w1t~ specul~t10n m ~h.e foreign exchange markets by multinational
compames or.wlth nefan~~s. pohCles of financial directors- aspects which were
often e~phas1zed by poht1c1ans. Rather, it was a matter of simple arithmetic.
Inflatwn meant that more money had to be put into inventories and work
in progress, which absorbed funds that otherwise could have been invested
in long-term product research and development. And as the cost of new equip-
ment and processes mounted, firms were constrained to cut back their trading
level to keep business within the bounds of available financial resources.
The inflationary environment was forcing increasingly difficult choices on
business managers, as they strove just to keep their firms in place and not lose
ground. Yet their decisions were often greeted with abusive political attacks
which ignored the simple facts they had to face. This was leading to a spirit of
anxiety and rebelliousness among middle and upper level managers, which
was an unhealthy development, as industry was after all our major creator of
wealth.
A Canadian speaker referred to the constantly escalating costs (in real, not
nominal terms) of new plant construction. At these inflated cost levels, there
was no motivation for industry to bring in new capacity to produce primary
commodities: energy, minerals, chemicals, metals, forest products. And with-
out new capacity in these areas - on which the rest of our economy was
built- he saw no physical basis for a lasting upturn from the present worldwide
recesswn.
An American participant pointed out that efforts to ameliorate the social
costs of orthodox anti-inflation policies had caused a shift in the source of
aggregate demand away from savings and business investment towards ~on­
sumption and government spending. Capital creation was further penahzed
because, under existing accounting procedures and tax laws, the underdepre-
ciation of business assets and inventory profits produced by inflation were taxed
as if they were ordinary income from operations. As a result of inflation, in-
come taxes had thus become a vehicle for taxing capital.
In combination with more consumption and government spending, :he
prolongation of inflation's corrosive effects on business profits a~~ capital
investment had, in his opinion, produced many of the market sc~~CltleS of the

Because of these uncertainties, unions fdt impelled to !!hortrn rhr contract

"ripple ~f dis~omfort runn~ng through the economic body" had been felt at the
onset ofm~atwn a generatiOn ago. Now the workers felt virtually nothing until
the exploswn burst around them, and they were psychologically unprepared
for the necessarily painful remedies. Although Canada's unemployment rate
had passed seven per cent, there were currently more than wo,ooo unfilled
jobs in that country.
The inequities wrought by inflation in eroding the value of savings were
alluded to in several interventions. A Belgian speaker referred to inflation as a
"fiscalite sauvage" which weighed most heavily on the weak and helpless. Thus
no civilized society could tolerate it for long.
D. Political and social repercussions. A French participant said that inflation was
synonymous with injustice. No political program aimed at a systematic better-
ing of social justice could have any hope of succeeding until inflation was
brought under control. There would consequently be a threat to democracy so
long as certain trade unions and political parties supported inflation as a
means of achining their ends.
It seemed to a Belgian speaker as if authoritarian regimes of both left and
right must be pleased by the prospect of seeing the democratic system fall
into serious trouble because of inflation.
The implications of inflation for the security of the West were dealt with in
other inten·entions. In the judgment of a British participant, any significant
pull-back in our investment in long-term research and development would
contribute to the process of decomposition in the West and give comfort to
those seeking to reduce the area of human freedom.
A German spoke of the growing importance of economic issues in the formu-
lation of foreign policy. He alluded to Secretary Kissinger's recent statement t?
the effect that an alliance without close cooperation and readiness for harmom-
zation in the fields of the economy, foreign trade and currency policy would be
impaired in its effectiveness as a defense community. Military defense ':as a
vital aspect of security but not the only one, and the disruptive :ffects ofmfla-
tion could only be prejudicial to the strength of the NATO alhance.

An American participant saw thc root" of inf1.11ion ;u l)('ing mort' JOCiaJ and
political in nature than cconomic. The inflation of thr p.ut cfrC".ldt" h.ad lxnl
caused primarily by govcrnmcnts trying to solw thrir pnlitic.1J diffiC"ullin with
more money instead of better idras. Thr author of thr C;11101di.1n working paptr
agreed that inflation had bcen brought nn IJ\· thr atrrrnpt to u.- mont'tary
policy to resolve conflicts within so•iety. Oncr wr had ~ot .1,,.•1~- from a syskm

we found a way of placing constraints on our politic.JI k.1cfen, our ~ietits
would have to contend with this chronic- inflationarv hi;u.
A Dutch speaker saw an even simpler way of si;in~ up thr prohlrm: 0\"t'T
the past decade, productivity in the industrial world h.1d grown hy about
four per cent a year, and in the less-d<'vdopcd world hv under two pc'r «nt,
g~vin~ a r~ugh annual average of, say, three to thrrr and ;a f1.1ff prr ce-nt. The
high mfla~wn rate we were experiencing was thr prier fi1r h.1ving ~aid "Yts"
to expenditures that exceeded that growth in productivitv. \\'r would now
have to do more than fashion monetary constraints. \\"c 1~rrdrd to srt some
upper limit of expenses for our social system, a bon· which it was agrc-rd that
we should ~rmly say "No". Otherwise, there would onr dav br no .;nivrrsitirs
fi
fcor 1
economists to teach at nor parliaments in which politi~ians could debate
ree y.
In the judgment of a French speaker, the elite of our societies had to ~ar
a l~rge .share. of resp~nsib.ility .for the recent "demobilization" in the combat
agamst mflauon, havmg given m on the grounds that inflation was a "tolerable
substitute for revolution". The expression of this attitude on the part ofintellec-
tual leaders had done much to undermine the public resolve to resist inflation
which was particularly needed in view of the weakness of governments and
central banks.
A Belgian participant countered that it was too easy for various social
groups to criticize one another. We all had to share the blame for inflation.
Industrialists and financiers felt that they were getting even in a way for the
policy of full employment, high wages and a more humane standard ofliving.
Trade unions and their workers had been "brainwashed" into accepting the
myth ofproductivity and consumption leading to a material paradise on earth;
when they experienced reverses, they were apt to blame the economic system.
Governments, for their part, were called on increasingly to intervene in econom-
ic life, and their approach to the resolution of problems had been too feeble
or too facile.
The speaker even suggested that the industrial nations as a whole merited
their current economic predicament, having enriched themselves for years with
the raw materials of the underdeveloped regions. (A Turkish participant
disputed this. The developed countries had grown rich by exploiting their own
people, he said. The less-developed world would not have even known that it
had riches to be exploited had it not been for the prospecting of the others.)
Having listened to a number of interventions dealing with the social and
political background of inflation, a Swedish participant confessed to a feeling
offrustration. It was no doubt true that the present inflationary process depended
on the working of fundamental factors in our societies, and reflected some
basic weaknesses. It was important to have those fundamentals in mi~d when
debating economic policies. But if our fight against inflation had to watt for the
solution of basic social problems we should all be dead. As the author of the
Dutch working paper remarked, 'overcoming inflation was a condition of social
reform, not vice versa.
B. The full employment commitment. As the Canadian working paper pointed
out, most Western governments had since the end of the Secon.d .World .War
undertaken to guarantee full employment as a matter of overndmg n~twnal
. . . . h. fi 11 ployment commitment

h · · ·n order to stem rising prices. Their dilemma was compounded
t e1r economies 1
of economic and political elements. . .
On the side of economics, inflation was known to abate with recesswn, but
only with a time lag which was growing pr:Jgr~ssi\:ely lon~c~r ~\·.ith each_ successive
economic cycle. Faced with market and mstitutwnal ngtditte_s, b~st_ncss often
found it more economic- at least initially- to take the brunt of dccluung aggre·
gate demand in the form ofreduced output and employment rather th<m in lo~n·r
prices. With wage rates institutionally fixed, a manufacturer could cut pnces
only so far before he was selling below his out-of-pocket costs. Hence, he
would reduce output and lay off workers in order to an>id cash losses.
At the same time, social welfare institutions rendered unemployment less
and less deflationary. While the output of the unemployed fdl to zero, their
incomes and their effective demands were increasingly supported by gowrn-
ment transfer payments. Under these circumstances, the basic inflationary con·
clition of too much money chasing too few goods was not quickly corrected by
higher unemployment.
As for the political side of the dilemma, the schedule of elections was not
permitted to lag. Thus the economic cycle might han· become longer than the
political cycle. Unemployment might reach politically unacccptahlc lewis
before a decisive victory against inflation could be achie\Tcl. Expansion then
rekindled the flames of inflation and the wage-price spiral resumed its upward
course. In recent years, real growth and in\-cstment spending in all modern
economies had suffered from the stop-and-go policies of altnnately stepping
on the accelerator and the brake, as the priority target shifted hack and forth
between inflation and unemployment.
It was these effects of the full employment policy that were the taproots of
contemporary inflation, the speaker concluded.
A French intervention related inflation to the growing cost of financing
the full employment commitment in the advanced industrial countries. The
management of aggregate demand was the chosen instrument to achicw full
~mployment. But as costs rose throughout the economy, because of wage

of "savings" that would otherwi.,e not have been available. It thus served t
camouflage disequilibria by successiH·ly readjusting structural imbalance~
rather than correcting them -a job which nobody wanted to tackle. The classic
readjustment mechanisms of monetary policy, direct controls, and Keynesian
demand management had pron:d inadequate, in that they transferred inflation-
ary effects from simple price rises to more pernicious forms such as wholesale
waste and premature obsolescence.
In short, weak societies ,.,:ithout much in the way of a consensus or common
objectives - except their costly commitment to full employment - had seized
upon inflation as a way of partitioning wealth among conflicting social groups,
without any criteria, through a de,·aluation of the medium of exchange.
Another French participant argued that it was unfair to hold Keynesian
full employmrnt policy responsible for inflation, and inflation in turn respon-
sible for unemploymrnt. \\'e had in fact experienced many periods in which
high employment had coincided with perfect price stability. Blaming unem-
ployment on inflation would require the acceptance of rather far-fetched hy-
potheses. The causal relationships were in truth not as simple as that.
There were a number of strains of inflation, and the ultimate effect ofrestric-
tive policies could vary greatly from case to case. Cost-push inflation, for in-
stance, was caused by "exterior forn·s", not by excess demand. It was true that
combatting it with restricti\T policies would, by slowing down economic
activity generally, tend to reduce raw material prices, but the final impact of
this on total value-added prices was rather attenuated. Because of these subtle
and complex cause-effect relationships, the speaker thought it was a mistake
to focus on full employment policy as a primary cause ofinflatio~.
A Belgian participant suggested that full employment as a policy goal ~~ght
to be replaced by the conccpt of a guaranteed minimum stand~rd of ~Iv~ng.
Problems of structural unemployment, especially in the Western I.ndustnahzed
countries, could then receive the special attention that they reqmred.

author of the Dutch working paper reiterated his conviction that it was not
only helpful but indeed indispensable to recognize inflation as a monetary
phenomenon, and that this did not necessarily lead to one-sided monetarism.
The very possibility of inflation depended on the existence of money. Money
translated relative prices into a price level. A general increase in the money
supply was therefore of necessity the cause - or at least a condition - of infla-
tion. It followed that one could prevent or stop inflation by the implementation
of an appropriate monetary policy. (Whether this was always wise remained
to be seen.)
It was hard to say exactly what was the right size of the credit pyramid
(or the money supply), but some sizes were surely wrong. Technically speaking,
the supply of money ought to be an independent variable, that is an instru-
ment of policy. If it were ever regarded as a 1 oo per cent dependent variable,
the inflation problem would be by definition insoluble. Failure to recognize
inflation as a monetary phenomenon made it impossible to grasp the essen-
tials of the problem.
D. The supply side of the equation. As an American observed, if one cause
of inflation was too much money chasing too few goods, then more attention
ought to be paid to the supply side of the equation. The excessive emphasis
on maintaining aggregate demand had become positively non-Keynesian in
its failure to recognize the critical importance of capital accumulation to sup-
port that demand. Insufficient inducements - and indeed barriers - to the
expansion ofindustrial capacity and productivity were responsible for aggravat-
ing inflation.
A Swedish participant agreed that the supply side should be emphasized
much more in our overall policies. This would prove more difficult, though,
than manipulating the demand side. . ..
Another American foresaw a tendency towards steadily nsmg real costs as
we continued to press upon our resources, even assuming that cyclical pressures
could be moderated. ·

E.lnttmali0711Jl ramifications. \\'hile inflation could be said to be an interna-
tional phenomenon in the sense that it was manifesting itself simultaneously in
most countries of the world, one had also to look at the dynamics of inter-
national developments for causes of the disease itself.
An Italian participant suspected that, when too many "good reasons" were
advanced for some phenomenon, a simpler and more specific explanation
might be lying in the background. In the midst of all the causes that had been
cited, one could not help asking why virulent two-digit inflation had broken
out in 1974 and not a decade earlier.
A compatriot responded by pointing out that the quickened pace of world
inflation had coincided with the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system.
Several other participants agreed that the current international monetary
disorder had not helped efforts to contain inflation. A Frenchman remarked
that global reserves had doubled in the past four years, a process which could
not go on blindly.
Another French participant was encouraged by talk of plans to impose
controls on the abusive growth of the Eurodollar market. At the same time,
he contended that the adoption of floating exchange rates had in fact hel~ed
in the fight against inflation by giving governments a degree of control which
they had lacked under the system of fixed rates. . . .
The international transmission of inflation, though, was intensifymg, and m
defending themselves against it nations were adopting protectionist attitudes.
This ran counter to everything we had been saying for the past 15 years ab~ut
how inflation would gradually disappear as the EC liberalize~ trade a.nd m-
vestment. Paradoxically though just the opposite was happenmg: the mtrac-

This intervcn tion, and one by an American participant, aho aDuded 10 lht
world-wide inflationary effects of a dccade of :\mcric41n paymadl ddicits.
The dollar was now b~ing used to finance in,trad the oil-~bced de6cils r:i
other countries, a situation that thc t'S might not accrpt inddiaiteJy.
A Turkish intervention dealt with the spe-c-ial r.uun of infblioa ia lht Its-
developed countries. The German working p;apc-r had ..uributed tbt pmiscrnt
and "galloping'' inflation in thosr countries to thr politicAl impallibiliry r:i
raising enough taxes to mct"t the nrrds of thr st.ltt". The ruWbDf ~
gap was filled by excessive monry cn·ation, with a CORK"qUCDI ritt iD prict
levels. The speaker conceded that thrre was som<'thing to chit, but ht thoupt
it was only realistic to recognizt> that tax rrform would ha\""t" 10 await RpUficant
increases in per capita income.
At the same time, it had to be admitted that othcr facton had helped to fuel
inflation in countries such as Turkey: (a) the bu11int"ss community, mindful r:i
high profit margins on new investmrnt, prrll.'lurrd tht' go\Tmmt'niiDCI bub
to advance them more funds than thme availablt' from normal •vUJ&s;
(b) inflation was imported from the industriali7.rd countries tJvoup price
increases on imported goods and rrmittances from workt'n abroad (coming
mainly t~ low-income groups with a low saving propensity); and (c) IU'OOg
tr~de .umons usually succeeded with thrir dt'mands for wage incra.ICI out·
stnppmg productivity gains. Demand-pull inflation thus tended to be com-
pounded by cost-push effects.
An Irish speaker asked whether the great dinnity in ratn of inftadoa &om

III. Prescribing a curt for inflation
A. The importance ?fmo~etary ~olicy. Despite the wide variety ofviews expressed
about the causes of mflatton, nrtually no participant was prepared to exclude
a dose of monetary policy from his prescription for a cure. An exception was
perhaps the Italian speaker who reckoned that monetary policy would be
inappropriate for treating a world-wide inflation caused by a scarcity of natural
resources, for two reasons: (a) such policy could not operate to channel
resources into the development of new sources of supply; and (b) monetary
restraint tended to dry up reservoirs of investment capital just when they were
most wanted. He saw the inflation problem primarily in terms of ecology and
population growth.
~lany of the participants, however, who agreed that monetary policy should
be an ingredient in any anti-inflation medicine, expressed reservations of one
sort or another about its use and its effectiveness. According to a British speaker,
control of the money supply could be frustrated by increases in the velocity of
the circulation of money, as well as by the time lag between any action and
its consequences for demand, prices and employment. For example, the
American authorities - not recognizing the seriousness of the recession facing
them - had failed to act in time and were now taking measures which could
prove excessive and lead to a new wave of inflation in three or four years'
time.
Moreover, given the current levels of unemployment benefits, monetary
restraint was not likely to bring the rate of inflation down by itself, except at
the cost of many years of levels of unemployment much higher than any
democratic society would accept. .
For an American, the difficulty of over-reliance on pure monetary policy
began with the fact that - in the US anyway - there were currently at _le.ast
eight defined categories of monetary liquidity, not just one ~r two.. In deCidt~g
which monetary elements to control, it would therefore be n~posstble to avmd
some measure of discretionary policy. Even then, a focussmg on m?netary
restraint tended to overlook the major problem of underinvestment
111
b?th
the industrialized and less-developed countries. An important -arm agamst
inflation in the future would be a strong productive base. . fl .

monetary policy on company finances would be unusually rough when drscend-
ing from the level of two-digit inflation. This could present an adjwtment
problem of unprecedented severity.
The further consequences of the impact of monetary restraint on the produc-
tive sector were analyzed by another I talian participant. He began by remind-
ing the meeting that monetary policy had been the chosen irulrUment to
combat the three major inflationary outbreaks in his country during the past
dozen years. There had been two reasons for this choice: ! 1) monetary policy
was deployed by the most independent power ccn tcrs; and (2) it promised the
quickest effect. On each occasion, the inflation, accompanied by balance of
payments deficits, had been due to the convergence of interior and exterior
forces. At home, the granting of wage increases in excess of productivity gains
had produced a cost-push effect. Abroad, the higher wages already attained in
more industrialized countries of the EC had tended to pull I talian wages up
to their level, as often happened in imperfectly integrated economic S}"Sterru.
Two of these outbreaks of inflation had occurred during periods of permissh·e
monetary policy, while the other had happened at a time of monetary restraint,
so that the relation between monetary policy and a rise in costs and prices
could not be said to have been well documented by recent Italian experience.
Nonetheless, action in the monetary sphere had served to stop the spiral in
all three instances. Two perverse effects were to be noted, however, in the
case of Italy. First of all, because of the relatively broad zone of rigidity in
that country's economy, the effects of monetary measures were concentrated on
the productive sector. While exports increased and domestic consumption
dropped, the less efficient firms either disappeared or were swallowed up by
state .enterprises. Thus one effect of monetary restraint in the face of cost·
push mflatwn had been the extension of the public sector.
Anot~er consequence of the application of monetary policy had been the
paralysis of capital k h. h fc .

?ebt financmg. With the resulting decline in the relative stake ofshareholders'

policies"), allied to more flexible discretionary monetary policies, with some
attention devoted to the problem of international reserves. (This speaker
felt, incidentally, that it was unfair to saddle Keynes with responsibility for
the present wave ~[inflation, his theories ha\·ing been formulated with a system
of fixed, not flexible, exchange rates in mind. A British participant added
that it was likewise unjust to attribute an isolationist bias to Keynes.)
Another Briton, while endorsing the \·alue of monetary policy, described as
artificial the argument about whether inflation was pushed up by wages and
salaries or by the money supply. If it was held to be wages, that meant simply
that the money supply was seen as a passive factor moving in response to wage
increases. ~lonetarists, on the other hand, believed that wage increases them-
selves could not exert an important independent impact, as their aggregate
effect could be limited by mon<'y supply controls.
Referring to the growing tendency to use control over money in resolving
social conflicts, the author of the Canadian working paper asked what kinds
of constraints on govnnmcnt could be devised to replace the old automatic
constraints such as the gold standard. He was not confident that the sheer
political process would do the trick.
One practical answer to such questions was offered by the author of the
German working paper, who described the solution being tried in his country
this year. On the basis of the recommendations of their economic advisers, the
chancellor and the c<?ntral bank had agreed on the target of an eight per cent
increase in the mon<'y supply for 1975. The central bank was bound to pursue
policies consistent with that objective and to coordinate its actions with those
of the government. An escap<' clause had been provided for excepti.onal circu~n­
stances, and a certain flexibility in application was unavoidable m the begm-
ning. But one had to know in which direction one wanted to head.
To a Dutch participant who wondered whether it was appropriate in demo-
cratic societies for central bankers to be undisputed decision makers, free of
political control, the German author replied that he was not adv~cating the
use by central bankers of discretionary powers in an undemocratic way. He
was thinking in terms of a quasi-constitutional law requiring the central bank
to adhere to certain goals in cooperation with the government.

It was to b: noted that the author's concept of monetary policy was not a
narrow techmca~ ~ne. It _referred to everything that might influence the supply
ofmoney,compnsmg basi~ally three components: credit creation by the banking
system on b_ehalfof the pnvate sector, the financing of borrowing requirements
of the pubhc sector not from genuine savings, and the deficit on the balance
of payments. Fiscal policy was thus a part of monetary policy in its wider sense,
and both central banks and governments were instruments of policy.
B. Fiscal measures. An American participant felt that a big step forward had
been taken with the conversion to more discretionary management of fiscal
policies in the context of our economic expansion. But, having discovered the
"magic" of discretionary management, we had found it hard to accept the
fact that it required greater self-discipline than automatic systems. Discarding
this notion of discipline was like throwing out the baby with the bath water.
The old concept of an always balanced budget, which the new fiscal policy
tended to replace, had had the \'irtue of imposing a certain fiscal discipline
by providing a crude cost/benefit calculus. The speaker thought it would be
necessary to work something like this back into the picture, and the current
German experience deserved sympathetic study, even by those who were
generally not enthusiastic about guidelines and monetary rules. ,
The whole budgetary process- in the US at least- would have to go much
further in laying out empirical evidence about the implications of the decisions
now being made about total claims on national economic resources.
A Swedish participant also thought that the various recommendations
contained in the German working paper deserved careful consideration. He
went on to say that the synchronization effect of economic policies had been
widely underestimated, so that their total effect (both deflationary and reflation-
ary) was much greater than anticipated. It had been a mistake~ in his opinion,
to concentrate reflationary efforts on a general stimulation ofpnvate consu~p­
tion through tax cuts and increased transfer payments. This was an ~xpe~si~e
way of reducing unemployment, as it created great inflationary nsks m Its
later phases and led to a mis-allocation of resources.
The speaker said that a study of the inflationary phase of 197~-74 would be
useful in avoiding a repetition in I 977-78. One thing was certam: ~hat m?re

Real national income was ultimately distributed between the private
sector (net wages and net profits) and the collective sector (real government
expe~diture and so~i~l welfare payments). Real wages had to bear a proper
relauon to producunty, so that profits were sufficient to insure adequate
investment levels. That defined what was left for the collective sector. Taxes and
social security premiums should not endanger the proper levels of wages and
profits.
All this had to be worked out and implemented in guidelines for wage nego-
tiations and price policies. \Vhether these guidelines were to be voluntary or
statutory dependt'd on the severity of the situation as well as the political and
psychological make-up of the country concerned.
The author of the German working paper explained that he regarded
incomes policies as a necessary complement to the essential monetary policy.
In this wider context, his concept of "radical incomes policies" included
measures for increasing the supply side, such as by stimulating exports from
lower wage countries.
In the short run, incomes policies in terms of wage restraint were required
to reduce the rate ofinflation. In the medium term, though, they were necessary
to maintain a high level of employment. Inflation could be fought without
an incomes policy so long as one did not care about unemployment. But to
prevent unemployment, trade unions had to restrain their wage demands.
This relationship between incomes policies, productivity and employment
had been generally overlooked, and it had to be made clear tha~ when tr~de
unions were negotiating about (real) wages, they were at the same time negotia.t-
ing about job security and the number of people who would be employed -m
individual firms in regions and in whole countries.

But the German public had not been propcrlv inliJrrncd about the lower
scope for productivity and wage increases, with the ~~~nsc·q~rnc.c that nominal
wage increases turned out to be around 1:2 per: tTnt. I o nl<llntaan ~mpl?ymrn1

The actual increase in the price InTI prmTd to lw of thr order of SC\rn

there, however, in the sense that there were percentage ceilings on overall
wage increases every year.
A British participant endorsed the use of incomes policies in the face of
advanced inflation, but preferably not by statutory means, which were too
rigid. If they were statutory, it should at any rate be for only a short period, to
allow time for the government to cut public expenditures and re-assess its
political objectives.
Another British speaker thought there was a role for incomes policies of
some sort (a) for countries facing severe economic difficulties, and (b) as an
educative device to make people understand inflation. On the other hand,
these policies tended to institutionalize the monopolistic elements in the
economy- in both business and trade unions- as we set up national bargaining
forums. The risk was that the whole economy would be tugged from side to
side as different political parties succeeded each other in office.
A Belgian participant was apprehensive too that involving the monetary
authorities in refereeing an incomes policy would immediately politicize
them.
In the judgment of a British speaker, an incomes policy would not work
for long without the consent of the trade unions, and unless it worked for
several years it might leave the situation worse than when it started. On: could
only in turn get the consent of the unions if there were a degree of social and
economic consensus over a very wide range of problems in the country con-
cerned. The substance of the consensus was perhaps not so important.
An International participant thought that for an incomes policy t? work

ened into other fields, notably political life- a fact which union leaders, as well
as employers and political leaders, we1-e well ach iscd to keep in mind. In the
free trade union movement, the majority of members had to accept the result
of any wage negotiation. Under.this democratic sy~'tn!1, workers al\\:ays came
back to these fundamental questiOns about wages: \\hat am I gctung as an
increase?" and "What is the other fellow getting?''
In Norway, in recent years- and probably in othn Scandinavian countries
too - workers had come to accept a form pf incomes policy worked out in
partnership with employers and the gonTnnH·nt. In doing so, thry had learned
to insist, however, on the distinction bctwf'cn nominal and rf'al wage increases
(the latter taking account of the tax burden in calrulating disposable income.
Scandinavia was also moving towards co-determination in industry, on the
theory that it gave workers greater S<ttisfaction and cflicicncy. It was not at all
clear, though, that this would in any way hdp sohc the prnhkm of inflation.
The East European experience ga\T little reason f(n optimism on that score.
The speaker's conclusion was that track unions and workers in industrial
countries would take a positive approach to incomes policies if they trusted
their governments and enjoyed good relations with their employers. But they
could not be expected to cooperate if they dccmrd that the undrrlying social

They had thought they were well protected for years ahead, only to see their
purchasing power decline by around 2. 7 per cent during the first year.
To a British particip;tnt. it seemed as if the redistribution of income were
already well under w<ty. The remarkable stability of the relative share of the
gross national product going to wages was undergoing a radical change.
Whrther or not one welcomed this c\nTiopment, there was no denying that
futurr capital formation would be more arduous if the share of income going
to current pri\·ate consumption \vas increased (on top of that already going

Another Briton- identifying himself as a socialist - counsellrd "treading wry
carefully" towards equality of inconw distribution lest we destroy the mrcha·
nisms of investment. In his Yiew, it would he better to put the accent rather
on the sharing of power. Trade unions should he offered a greater say in
running their companies and shaping their cm·ironment, in exchange for
their restraining their monetary demands.
A Canadian speaker thought that workers in his country would not find
such a bargain appealing. It was not that they were not interested in their
environment or in what their companies could do li1r the general wdf.1rr. It
was simply that they saw their job as one of production, with managrmrnt
being not just the privilege but also the burdm of the profrssional business·
man. The danger society faced was that each group would follow its own
selfish objectives, only to end up "fighting owr the bones".
A Briton, speaking from the point of \·iew of an industrial manager, said
that he would have no objection in principle to seeing trade unions assume a
sha:e .of management responsibility in rxchange fi)r some moderation of
their Inflationary demands. But this would make srnsc onlv if the unions
proved_ good at that job. Business management today was a .highly complex
profess10? sta~ed by knowledgeable and able people. Assuming that some
rebalancmg might be needed in the area of industrial relations it was essential
that it be done in a way that would not dilute the quality of b~siness manage-
ment.
The de~eterious effects of price fixing and of related forms of direct controls
were outlined by an A · · · · 11

fi h '. · eu eory was that one way ofstopping too much money
romldc asmg too few goods was to impose controls on the amounts consumers
cou spend for a given p d t b fi . . . . .
ro uc Y xmg Its pnce, Ignonng the marketplace.
But that policy was doomed to failure unless governments were prepared to tell
the consumer, first, how much he should pay and, second, how much he should
buy - otherwise s~pply would not balance demand. By their very nature,
controls served to dtstort the operation of the marketplace, to blunt incentives,
to generate bottlenecks, and generally to breed inefficiencies and inequities
as one controlled to another.
In the terms used by the author of the German working paper, controls
were damaging because they fed misleading information into markets and
erected artificial barriers to normal business procedures. In effect, they
increased economic transaction costs.
A good example of the disruptin: effects of price controls was to be seen in
the American petrolrum industry. The US had a "two-tier" pricing system
for crude oil. Thr price of oil from old oil fields was held at less than half the
world price, while "new" domestic oil and imports sold at the world price.
This boon to consumers who got domestic supplies for less than replacement
costs was justified by its proponents as anti-inflationary.
The system gave a competitive advantage to integrated refining companies
who happened to have found and developed an above-average proportion of
"old" oil. That caused other refiners to complain in Washington. One control
had bred another, the result being an equalization scheme under. which
refiners with a stronger position in low-cost oil had to pay cash to the
1
r com-
petitors every month.

D. The if.fects of indexation. Indexation o~ \·arious :orts as a p<~lliati\·c .fo.r the
effects ofinflation was dealt with in scYeral mtern~nuous. :\ Belgian partiCI~ant
remarked that since 1948 his country had dcn·lopcd the most generalized
system of indexation in Europe. Roughly ;o per cent of thC' G:\~ was .tied
to the retail price index, and followed it in \Try close rhythm, with adjust-
ments made every one to three months. Old-age pcnsious and social hcm·fits
were covered, as well as most rental contracts and about 90 per cent of wages
and salaries (plus the remuneration of some of the liberal professions .
Nevertheless until 1973-74 Belgium had enjoyed the lowest inflation rate in
Europe, with the exception of Germany. During the past two years, though,
she had begun to slip anchor, with accelerating price increases. The speaker
thought that the indexation system, which had helped insure social harmony
in Belgium, deserved study on a European scale. Besides the palliation it
provided, it could also have positive dynamic effects in attracting im-cstors to
indexed bonds and in forcing businessmen to run their operations as rflicicntlr
as possible.
Another Belgian agreed that social tranquillity could be promotrd by in-
dexing certain components of economic life. But a general indexation was
an avowal of defeat in the battle against inflation. In inflationary prriods, it
was important that wage increases be based on a true and fair rrtail price
index. The speaker thought that indexation had been relatiYclv succrssful in
Brazil because it was not really generalized. It was known ~o br jugglrd
around a bit and applied with a certain time lag. Labor there bencfitrd kss
from indexation than it appeared, but did not h;\T the political powrr to do
much about it.
A French participant pointed out that indexation was not im·ariably
opposed by conservatives. Some of the most audacious proposals in this field
h~d i~ fact been advanced by Milton Friedman. But the speaker could not
VIsualize a systern of gene I · d · 1 · · ·

Another Frenchman pointed out that indexing interest rates in order to
~ttract large quantities of long-term funds on a durable basis would tend to
mcrease borrowing co t b t · II
s s su s antta y. As the cost of funds went up borrowers

th' h ec me. o t e speaker the implication of a
lis w~s t at we would have to be much more selective,in our future im·estment
p annmg.
A British participant was inclined to
agree with the preceding speaker that
indexing rates of interest would inflate im·estment costs enormously. He was
skeptical anyway about the benefits of indexation. For one thing, it would
serve to destroy the "money illusion". For another, it would not necessarily lead
to greater savings by working class people. There seemed to be a long-run
correlation between their wages and their savings habits which would not be
easily changed whatever was done.
The Belgian participant whose remarks were summarized at the beginning
of this section questioned the conclusion that the indexing of interest rates
would necessarily lead to higher interest rates. It could easily be envisaged
that investors would he offered two separate regimes, one indexed and the other
not. The former might entail nominal rates of practically zero. With reference
to the working class attitude towards savings, the speaker thought this was a
special question that had very little to do with interest rates or indexation.
The author of the German working paper argued forcefully in favor of the
notion of bond indexing. To begin with, it would attract into the capital
market many small savers who up to now had believed that the only hedges
against inflation were in real estate, gold and other tangibles. This tended
to produce distortions in a country's overall investment structure. Moreover,
the indexing of interest on government bonds would act as a constraint on
government spending, by putting the state and its citizens in the .sam_e boat, so
to speak. The government would soon become as anxious to avoid high future
inflation rates as the public was. .
Therefore, any government which was serious about embarkmg on a
d
· d · · dexed bonds
program to reduce inflation would be well a vtse to Issue m .
bearing a low (even zero, or negative) nominal rate of interest. For' with the

rates were to be indexed, another factor of inflexibility would be introduced
into the economic system.
Translated into social class terms, the decline in real interest rates implied
that if labor insisted on a larger slice of pie but business refused to gi\'e it out
of their profits, then the holders of fixed income securities and of money bala~­
ces had to yield part of their share. The inflation of recent years had resulted m
a transfer of income (a) from this latter class of sa\·ers to the two other orga-
nized groups (business and labor), and (b) from the less-developed countries
by shifting the international terms of trade against them.
The speaker's conclusion was that a comprehensiw indexing of sa\'ings and
other interest rates would not be practically workable. It would result in an
intensified profit squeeze, a decline in domestic inwstmcnt, and hence in income
and employment. Both labor and business would han· to give up ground
to property income receivers, an outcome that seemed politically unlikely.
E. Encouraging investment. In spite of the difference of views expressed about
supply shortages as a primary cause of inflation, there was broad agreement
about the importance of adequate capital inwstment to the future health of
our economies.
According to an American speaker, massi\·e capital invt>stments would be
required in the areas of energy, the environment, transportation and food
production. In addition, vast infusions of capital would be nt>eded to support
the great worldwide influx of young entrants to the labor force. l'nless a
gr~wing share of world income were diverted to satisfy these mounting re-
~u~rements, the outlook was bleak for maintaining the rapidly rising standardsof
hvmg that we had come to enjoy and expect since \Vorld \Var II.
. Several interventions underscored the role of tax incentives in stimulating
mvestm~nt. French and American speakers said there was no substitute for
appropnate fiscal measures in this regard. We had to organize our tax systems
so that they would not co 1 t · h · 0 0

A French participant ren~rtcd to his analysis of inflation as a deliberate
and nccesury means of financing our increasingly costly investments while
the produc~~ty _of capital wa~ dropping. Inflation constituted a tax on savings
and a subsid1zaUon of borrmvmg ·so long as neither of them was indexed).
The consequences of this state of affairs were far-reaching, even apart from
the inftationary aspects. :\s the proportion of self-financing in business gave
way to growing dcht financ-ing, management's control was inevitably weakened
and its "legitimacy" challenged.
All the aspects of investment - its nature, its location, its financing- wen~
increasingly insep<trabk from tlw problem of inflation. And since investment
shaped production and growth, social considerations were intimately involved
as well. Devising nrw and non-inflationary means of financing investments
should entail (a) reduc-ing inequalities of rc\-cnues through incomes policies,
(b) amending tax laws so as to diminatc profits made from inflation and specu-
lation, and (c) scrrening future inn·stmcnts to eliminate wasteful and unpro-
ductive projects. Thr speaker particularly advocated an orientation towards
investments which trndcd to crratc rather than suppress employment, and
which tended to incrrase the productivity of capital rather than of human
labor. He admitt('(\ this ran counter to the accepted "logic of capitalism."
The speaker foresaw intensified competition among European countries
and with the CS to attract new inwstmcnt projects. The intensity of this con-
flict would be aggra\·atnl hy the fact that key invcstme~t decisi~ns _wer~
concentrated in the hands of a rclatin·ly few managers of gwnt multmatwna
corporations. Bccausr of the political importance of these decisions, we. sho~ld

F. The international agenda. Mention having been made in many inter\'entions
of the international aspects of inflation, several participants suggested that
the cure had likewise to be conceived on an international basis.
Two Belgian speakers regarded improved international tra_de and monetary
relations as essential to the suppression of inflation. Otherwrse, we could not
expect any automatic adjustment mechanisms to work. .-\ Swedish participa~t
thought that international coordination was particularly necessary to a\·oid
aggregate overstimulation of our economies.
Another Belgian participant said he had found in all the working papers the
theme that the West, having got into a sort of economic cul-dt-sac, ought to
turn back onto the road towards total economic liberalism and orthodox mone-
tary policies - in short, that we should try unilaterally to restore order to our
economies. The speaker did not believe that approach would work. Just as our
problems were international in scope, so would our solutions have to be.
We had all become too self-centered, too narrow in our outlook. Europeans,
for example, had sought to take advantage of Amt>rica's difficultit>s by laying
at her door the blame for the breakdown of the Bretton \\"oods system. In
trade union circles, it was fashionable to criticize the multinational companies
(although they had probably been the first to rt>alize that the world rconomi-
cally was "one big parish").
In truth, said the speaker, we all bore some responsibility for our predic-
ament, and we could only hope to solve our problems by working togrther.
As the young people in all our countries Wt'JT especiallv concnned with the
"quality of life" and a just distribution of incomes, we \~·ould do well to start
putting moral values in the foreground of our consideration of economic and
monetary affairs.
A A · · ·
n ustnan participant observed that international collaboration on manv
ofthese matters was hard to achieve because our domestic political parties had
relatively little room for maneuver.
A Dutch speaker, who was convinced that inflation could not be solved on
a national basis called fcor th US J I

The author of the Grrffiilll workin~ papn also fdt that, although inflation
had become an intcrn<llion<d pht·nonwrwn, curati,·e treatments had to be
started on the national kvd. Tl11·y would nt·t·d to ,·ary from country to country

IV. Strengthening the wish to be cured.
A. The necessity for public awareness. As an Amnican partiCipant put it, ..it
is part ofthe cure to wish to be cured.'' If there was a _sih-er lining to thr black
cloud of inflation, he said, it was that our recent expcrwncc ought to help us to
be realistic. The enormous costs of inflation were now n·idcnt, as wrrr the
hazards- indeed the predictable damages- of fighting inflation with incrra~ing
government intervention in the economy. A.s the author of the Dutch worktng
paper had stressed, the costs of failure were infinitely higher than the ro~ts
of effective combat.
Another American pointed out that, since measures to curb inflation without
abridging human freedoms tended to increase uncmploymen t ~~ <lt kast in thr
short run), they were politically unpopular, if not unaccepta hk. \\"c therrforr
had to put at the top of our priorities a program to teach the public- and
public officials - that unchecked inflation operated to discourage inwstment.
retard economic growth, aggravate inequaliti!.'s in inconw distr·ihution and, in
the long run, increase unemployment. l'nkss we could make thesr farts
known, we risked losing the fight against inflation, and with it our lilwrty.
A fellow countryman agreed that a tremendous amount of education was
needed to create the base of public awareness on which political r!.'forms could
be built. An International speaker, on the other hand, felt that broad public
support for anti-inflation measures had already come into being. Thr recent
acceleration of inflation had scared people into a r!.'alization that their dlt)rts
to keep up were no longer manageable. The exposure of the inequities of thr
system had caused a less violent adverse reaction than might have been expect-
ed, but the public was now prepared to accept sacrifices.

was the task of pol't' I · ·

poh~y was. no longer a pure exercise in banking techniques but an arm of
foreign pohcy. '
s6
Another examp~e of a ra_ther subtle economic truth which had to be brought
home to the pubhc was Cited by a French speaker. He said that all too few
~liticians had had the courage to tell workers that increases in the price of
!IDports amounted to a real IT\TillH' loss for them which could never be com-
pensated for by monetary remunerations.
Lack of political cour<•ge was also deplored by a British participant, who
claimed that more than an a\-eragc dq~ree of it was required in his country,
where unemployment was the ''number one bogeyman". The job of public
education was probably easier in a country like Germany, with its memories of
inter-war inflation.
An American intt'nTntion suggested that much more than a public relations
campaign was rt'quircd. The speaker was conYinced that we would not make
headway in our struggk to teach the refinements of economics until our citizens
had learned the rudiments in school. How, he asked, did you advise a people
unequipped by training to follow the intricate arguments of economists that
they would not achicw what thcv desired to achieve by requiring from their
political leaders that which not o;1lv countenanced but required inflation?
In trying to bring some sense t<; the management of our public finances,
we had to contend with such ingrained axioms of socialistic thought as these:
{a) that money collected from the central political unit was money sponta_neous-
ly generated; and its corollary (b) that money was virtuously deployed msof~r
as one elongated the distance between where it was collected and where lt
was spent.
According to tlH:' author of the German working paper, the ~ducational job
had to extend to proving inflation's bad eflccts on the allocatwn of resources
and the stability of the social system. There needed to be much m~re collabu-

Moreover, we had to be realistic and to recognize that poltcy was cxcc_uted
by politicians in the real world. Elected leaders had tc~ be able to commumcate
their prescriptions to their constituents while conn·ying a sense of safc_ty an~
confidence. When business and labor negotiated mTr wages and pncrs, It
sometimes happened that an agreement added a fraction of a per rrnt to the
cost of living index more than we would haw liked. But this was a price \~·o:th
paying for the preservation of social stability and tlw amicable bargammg
process. . .
A participant from the United Kingdom ofrcred a description of how politi-
cians in the Conservative party there worked with economists and prople
from the business world in formulating policy. Regular discussion groups
were aimed at coming to grips with the pi·actical clements ofa current problrm,
and economists were not allowed to sit in a cornn mouthing thcir pet theorirs.
They were asked to speak in language that politicians could understand, as it
was believed that the master of a subject should be ahle to explain it simply.
The operating rules further required the group to reach some conclusions and
to reassemble in, say, three months' time, prepared to re\·iew those conclusions
in the light of intervening events. The party leadership had thus learned a
great deal about the course of inflation in the last three or fin~r vears that had
not been clear before. .
Although there was not always agreement about causes of economic phenom-
ena, this process generally produced agreement about practical steps to be
undertaken. Whatever was done in the end im·olved a political decision, and
economists were used to advise on techniques to efl'ectuatc that decision. As
~ong ~s t_he rate of inflation was low, politicians would shy away from fighting
It, clarmmg t~at one could live with inflation in order to prcserYc full employ-
ment and a hrgh level of social services. But when the rate of inflation made a
sufficient impact on people's lives, politicians would know that they stood a
good chance of organizing a consensus to oppose it. Such a consensus, though,
had to be made up of people who shared a common devotion to a free society
and a mix:d econ~my. Those who felt no loyalty to these values and who
stood to gam from mflation h d b · . . d
. . , a to e VIgorously fought on pohtrcal groun s.
In the oprmon of a F h · ·
h rene participant, the absence of political consensus
ad too often been used as t r d . . . .
d a pre ext tor omg nothmg. Economrc history
emonstrated that the notabl fi 1 ·
. d Ysuccess u campargns against inflation had been
carne out through "sho k"
c measures. In France, this had been true of the
Poincare stabilization of 1926, as well as the de Gaulle-Pinay stabilization of
1959· In both cases, the resulting under-employment had been of short dura-
tion.
Another French speaker criticized the tendency of modern politicians to
add continually to economic measures, rather than choose between them.
They seemed to have replaced the old maxim "gouverner, c'est choisir" with their
new motto "durtr, c'est ajouter" !in itself a kind of inflation).
An International participant was dismayed at the loss of time caused by
politicians and economists throwing the ball back and forth to each other.
Politicians had the vision and the potential will to lead the fight against
inflation, but all too often they had little interest in economic questions.
Economists, for their part, handled the issue very gingerly, claiming that their
solutions had to await th(' ('mergence of a new consensus or show of political
will.
What sort of consensus? the speaker wondered. If it was to be only among
those who were satisfied with the present social system and distribution of reve-
nue, we were bound to have difficulties. As for political will, one did not want
to appear cynical, but for a politician it boiled down to a curious mixture of
(a) trying to go with the stream so long as that could be reconciled with one's
vision of the common good, and (b) trying to build some constraints which
would enable one to s~y "I have to say 'no' because there are constraints I
cannot escape."
Having lost the old constraint of the gold standard, we would have to try
to find some new constraints in order to economize on that scarce resource
59
called "political will". . . . r .

framework of our economics.
A Turkish participant offered a com pre hemin· ,lfl.tlnis oht r11ct ur.tl dnclnp·
ments as they related to inflation. In her ,-icw, there w.1s .111 inhrr!'nl t!'ndrnrv
in present-day vVestern societies towards crn·ping intl.uinn. This W.IS r.IUS\d
by a downward inflexibility of industrial prices and wages. and h,- gonrnmrnt
intervention in agricultural products m;u·kets to eliminate .IllY price drclirw
likely to be caused by increased production at home or hy competition from
abroad.
These general price rigidities did not sen-e to explain the sudden outburst
of two-digit inflation in 1973, although it would help to assert that \\'estern
societies would be inflation-prone eYen after the present inflation had been
slowed down. One could invoke an additional factor likely to contribute in thr
6o
same direction: the likelihood of increased monopolistic arrangements on a
worldwide scale. The ."third and fourth worlds", inspired by the example of
OPEC, would be formmg cartels to mo\-e the terms of world trade in their favor
by increasing prices for their raw materials.
Moreover, within the \\"estern world itself, competition had been "eating
its own children". Competition among the few was leading to no competition
at all or competition among nTn the fewer. Even the fact that there was a
large area of factor and product prices which were becoming less and less
flexible downward - but easily flexible upward - meant that the structural
basis for creeping inflation had been laid down. Relative price changes led
inevitably to a rise in the general price ln-cl, and money supply increases
furnished the lubricating oil. The wonder was not that the price stability of the
past had become a fond memory, but that the price mechanism could still go on
carrying its allocative functions at all.
The speaker referred to the sugg<>stion in the German working paper that
more competition should b<.' encouraged through imports from less-developed
countries of agricultural products and labor-intensive manufactures. But such
products amounted to such a small percentage of the GNP of the industrialized
countries that little effect on price stability there could be hoped for by bringing
this sort of competition into their markets.
In general, it was the capital-intensive products - whose markets were
defined by oligopoly, and which were differentiated- that exhibited downward
price rigidities. But no effective competition could be invited from the overseas,
less-developed world in these industries, for either they had not been established

(c) Indexation Qj' savings and other interest rates wa~ not _pra~tically workable.
(See III, D, above for the speaker's argument on tillS su bjcct. J
(d) The multinational company, by pricing arrangements and m~rket-sh~ring
practices, was eliminating competiti\T price flexibility on an J~tcrnauonal
scale. By indulging in speculation in foreign exchange and commochty markets,
it fostered economic instability. The aggregate power of the .\1:'\Cs had become
far greater than that of many individual nation states. Some means had to
be devised on an international scale to control ~I~Cs or to create counten·ail.
ing forces to balance their "superpower".
(e) An increase in the supply of money was too easy an explanation for inflation.
Obviously, wherever and whenever inflation appeared it was accompanied by
an increase in total money expenditures. But u·h_r did money expenditures ha\e
to be increased? This was the question to which economists had to seek an
answer.
An American intervened to respond to the remarks of the preceding speaker
concerning multinational corporations. The vcry tnm implied trade between
countries, and the weight of the evidence was that international trade tendrd
to stimulate competition rather than eliminate it. Policies ofeconomic national-
ism, developed for whatever reason, tended to reward the less efficient pro-
ducer. In the final analysis, this had to be paid for, which hurt productivity and
fueled inflation.
T~e s~eaker went on to contend that foreign exchange speculation by
multmatwnal firms had been negligible. Such speculation detracted from the
proper business of industrial management and was well known to be a "hot
stove".
A Belgian participant agreed that more flexibility was needed in price
structures to enable cost · b ·
' savmgs to e passed along to consumers.
A French speaker felt that a reform of the structural basis of the business
wo:ld would y~e!d greater results in the fight against inflation than monetary
or mcomes poliCies. In particular, he would support:

(c) less costly types of growth: the fundamental transformation of the
commercial nature of our societies "in order to associate the unity of well-
being less with the wdfilrt· ofcapit<tl than with the welfare ofworking people."
:\British participant said that more sensitive planning mechanisms were
called for to help deal with structural changes. It was not that we necessarily
had to do more planning, but thilt we had to think more carefully about the
planning we did.
A German speaker found that the working papers and the discussion had
brought out the compkxity of the problem of inflation. \Vages were just one
element in the picture. :\nnthn important one was the fact that we were
passing through a period of accelerating technological change. This meant that
there was a growing time lag between recognizing social costs and introducing
the required technology. Our present environmental problems, which contrib-
uted to the cost of production, were just one factor among many. In a sense,
Western industrial societies were like companies that had been paying high
dividends for the p01st 2S years without srtting up reserves for depreciation.
We were now h01ving to settle that bill in one lump sum.
Economic life and political life wrre parts of one social system. While we
expected business decisions to br mack within their own frame of reference,
we somehow thought that politicians should forget their frame of re~erenc: -
which was not simply to get elected but also to work towards goals mvolvmg

In conclusion, the speaker said that we had to adjust the economrc part of
our social system to enable it to operate with more indi,·idual frerdom, more
equality and more internationalism. . . . .
An Irish participant wondered \vhether the competrti\T capuahst system
had not tended to undermine itself. It seemed to destroy the consensus nreckd
to make society work. Could we expect to han· competition as the rnoti\·ating-
force of an economic system and exclude it simultaneously from the social
system, where we expected cooperation within and among social dam·s? In
the speaker's view, our present inflation reflected t•xcessin· claims on limited
resources, unrestrained by any adequate communal commitment to society as
a whole.
A Dutch participant confessed that he had been surprised and puzzled b\'
the "restorative tendencies" eYidenced in the discussion and thr working
papers. These attitudes would produce beautiful goods and monuments, hut
was that what we really wanted? 'Ver·c we not willing to question at lrast
some of the assumptions underlying our analysis?
All the papers, for example, seemed to proceed from the hypothesis that
the market mechanism worked best and that C\Trything would be all right
if some corrections were made and some groups of people behawd brtter.
The speaker disagreed with that appmach. The social and economic order
was _there to balance interests, not to make them disappear. Howewr, that
apphed equally to the strong groups which had a ,·cstcd interest in inflation.
"The free market eats its own children," he went on. The textbook model of
the free market system was a technical construction made from attractiw
raw material, but the real thing did not exist. Whv did we insist on basing
economic analyses and policy recommendations on. an outdated model that
was unfit to solve today's national and international problems? Why were
~estern leaders still striving after a "phantom model of economic order"
mstead ~f taking up the challenge of re-thinking their problems?

wert to be slowed down.
Participating seriously in this re-thinking of the social and economic order
was the only avenue towards unity among the different political groups in
our societies. Far too much was at stake for us to suppress the consideration of
fundamental changes.
ACanadian speaker acknowledged that there had been many changes in the
basic assumptions under which goods and sen·ices had been produced in our
societies in the past. The old system had operated under laws which had been
largely unwritten but which had commanded general allegiance (what Lord
Moulton had called "obedience to the unenforceable"). Economic crises were
thought of as temporary disturbances, acts of God for which nobody would
think of blaming politicians. Today, the belief was widespread that the system
had ceased to serve its purpose, and many frankly wished for its destruction.
The speaker was struck bv the fact that everyone was now being expected
to operate contrary to his ow~ best interests. Labor unions were asked to restrain
their wage demands. Politicians were asked to take the long rather than the
short view, and to become saints in the bargain. Oil-producing countries were
asked to accept payment in debased Western currencies. Businessmen were
asked to exhibit restraint in pricing, whereas the old system ~ad not only
permitted maximization of prices but had actually depended on It to produce
the necessary balance. · ·

1. Tlrt prtsrnt status and prosputs of rfforts to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict, and
tht tJJ«t on rtlations amon.~.\"A TO "umbers.
The discussion. of this t<~pic was opened by a German partiCipant, who
offert·d the followm~ analys1s of the present \liddle East situation.
In his view, thr most ren·nt round of CS mediation had probably been
bound to fail IX"c;Hisc of the wry nature of the step-by-step approach. Each
step on the road to ;1 settlement had led towards ever higher obstacles and
further progress had finally lwcomr impossible without a clear view or'what
the last step would look like. Wr now had to try to envisage the shape that
a durablr peace in the \Iiddle East might take. There were three key elements
to the problem:
(1) Tht isJut of tht taritorin orrupied during the z967 war. Israel was convinced
that she had to retain these places and the Arabs were equally determined to
recover them:
(a) The Golan Heights, about which there was basically a military argu-
ment, and whose importance had bern disputed even among Israeli politicians;
(b) Sharm cl Sheik, and o\-erland access to Eilat, Israel's only Red Sea port;
(c) The chain of para-military outposts along the River Jordan; and
(d) Eastjcrusalem, part ofthejewish historic capital.
(2) The Palestinian question. No \liddle East compromise was foreseeable with-
out a settlement of the fate of the Palestine refugees. There was a Palestinian
nation which was entitled to a national home, and the Arab case was that this
should comprise at least the West bank of the Jordan and the Gaza Strip.
The arguments advanced against such a state were that it would inel~ctably
become a Russian satellite· that it would eventually fall to the Jordamans; or
that it would serve as a b~se for fanatical Palestinians bent on the destruction
of Israel. The opposite school of thought was that the establishme~t

(3) The world scene. The CS acting ;diJne could not bring about a compr~­
mise · Soviet participation was needed fi1r any c/J;tllCe of success. E\'en then, It
was ~ot clear that the superpower-s could impose a solution on the Arabs and
Israelis. Would an American guarantee of security be thinkable in the present
climate in \Vashington, or credible after \'ietnam? \\'ould an Iranian oil
guarantee for Israel be bclie\·ablc after the abandonment of the Kurds? Were
the Russians genuinely interested in peace in the ~Iiddle East? \\'hat role was
there for Europe and the u.N? There was a ddinitc European commitment to
the State of Israel (but perhaps not to an Israel which sought to define its own
boundaries without regard to the in terna tiona! situation;. Just how this commit-
ment would be implemented in any contingency was another question, but
there was no doubt that Europe, like the rest of the world, had an enormous
stake in Middle Eastern peace.
Another war there would be disastrous on sen-ral counts. It was likely to be
more destructive than the last war-, \vith a greater risk of widening into a
worldwide conflagration. It would almost ineYitahly im·olve another oil em·
bargo, longer and more intense than before. \ \"ith Europe's Bo per cent depen-
dence on Middle East oil, economic chaos and mass unemployment would
result. Moreover, another war would again generate friction between Europe
and the US about supplying Israel. \Vith the Azores no longer a\·ailable as a
fueling stop, Germany would try to play a substitute role, as she did not want
to see the balance of power tilted against the US in the ~Iiddle East. But there
might prove to be limits to that role. Further dangers would result from depict·
ing NATO arsenals in \Vestern Europe which might be needed in a European
contingency arising from a Middle East conflict.
An American participant outlined some of the reasons for the tactical
procedures pursued by l).is government during the last round of negotiations.
It had to be noted, first of all, that the US - which claimed no exclusi\'e role
in a Middle East settlement - had undertaken to act as intermediary at the
instance of the parties themselves, who had been disappointed by the results
o: face-to-face discussions. The choice of a step-by-step approach had recog-
mzed certain realities in the matter:
(r) the fragility of the political situation in Israel·
(2) the need to bu~ld confidence on both sides by first resolving the simpler
problems before movmg to more intractable issues·
(3) the ad:isability of not grouping various A;ab states together, which
would have giVen an advantage to extremist doctrinaire views·
~4) the ~istory oflost opportunities, such as Israel's failure t~ negotiate more
senously With King Hussein before the Rabat Conference· and
(5) the realization that the comprehensive approa~h advocated by the
Russians would have amounted to the formulation of an excessively complex
and legalistic agreement, known to be acceptable to the Arabs with the US
role limited to producing movement on the Israeli side. '
It appeared that this last round of negotiations had broken down because
of a lack of political ,,·ill. Without trying to weigh the blame, the speaker
thought that there had been a failure on the Israeli side to appreciate the
advantages of developing a rebtionship with a moderate Arab leader like
President Sadat, who had been prepared to negotiate without counter-
guarantees and to accept criticism for mo\·ing alone.
A French participant said that the basic cause of the failure of the recent
talks had been a misunderstanding as to the meaning of the "non-belligerence"
guarantee requested by Israel. To the Arabs, this had been seen as a political
decision tantamount to a peace settlement, which President Sadat had felt he
could not take, whereas the Israelis had viewed it merely as a first military
step towards peace. It ,.;as important for the superpowers to understand the
significance of this nuance, and of Israel's psychological need to be assured
of the Arabs' non-belligerence. \\"ith such an assurance, the speaker said,
there would be no real problem about releasing the occupied territories,
which most observers thought would be essential to a settlement.
According to an American participant, David Ben-Gurion had said that
Israel's pre-1967 borders were large enough for her future ambitions, and the
present Israeli government had assented to that notion in principle.
Another American said that some minor border rectifications might have
to be made and that the substantial demilitarization of the Golan Heights and
' db
other areas was recommended. American and Soviet troops, augmente Y
elements from other countries, could constitute a neutral peace-keeping force.

all the Palestinian people, both those on the \\'est bank and those m refugee
camps.)
The speaker went on to stress that it was importa~t now to t_ry to get the
Israelis and the Palestinians to talk to one another dtrectly. Thts could con·
ceivably be brought about by the efforts of pri\·ate citizens - European,
American, Japanese- who had such a large stake in ~fiddle Ea~tern peace and
who might be able to take initiatives that were foreclosed to thctr gO\·ernments,
in order to mobilize a sense of urgency.
In the opinion of a French participant, the importance and difficulty ~f the
Palestinian problem had been over-estimated. It was just one of a sene~ of
issues, and should be de-emphasized. At the negotiating le\·el, represrntattws
of the PLO had already been at the first Gene\·a Conference, and Israel was
engaged in conversations with Jordan about a zone along the River Jordan
where Palestinians could be resettled. It was admittt"dly ne\·t'r agret"ablc to
negotiate with people who resorted to terrorism, but in set"king peace one had
inevitably to deal with one's enemies.
A Turkish speaker felt that we should be as assiduous in seeking a solution
for the Palestinians as we had been in helping the Israelis with tht'ir national
home in the 194o's. What was needed above all was a spirit of fairness and
common sense.
We would probably soon be confronted with the problem of where to seat the
PLO at the Geneva Conference, which appeared likely to be reconvened.
Some participants held little or no hope that a solution would be found there.
A French speaker said that one could not isolate the analysis of the Arab-
Israeli dispute from that of the other conflicts around the fringes of Europe
that were going on today (e.g., Portugal) or probably would be tomorrow
(Yugoslavia). The failure of the last Kissinger mission was symptomatic of a
lack of real will for peace in the Middle East. The search for Arab unity,
having no economic foundation, had to be based on opposition to a common
adversary. All that could be hoped for in Geneva was to gain time, but the
risk was that the US and Europe, working at cross-purposes, would become
even more divided.
An American speaker indicated that the US government would be prepared
to return to Geneva, provided the conference were carefully prepared. Such
p:eparati~n coul~ include, among other things, further interim agreements
aimed at Improvmg the atmosphere and developing some confidence between
the parties.
Another US intervention advocated the urgent adoption of the following
course of action:. that Pres.ident Ford enunciate an American position, which
should be essenually to gtve flesh and blood to Resolution 242 of the UN
Security Council (for which there was allegedly overwhelming support in
Israel); that it be stressed that this position was advocated by the US indepen-
dently, not as a surrogate for Israel; that the American position should be
affirmed before the Russians could claim credit; that the US and Europe
should then work out a common position, on the basis of which they should
seek agreement with the Soviet C nion.
Such an East-West agreement would be based on the declaration made
after the 1972 Nixon-Brczhnev summit that the US and the USSR would use
their best efforts to remove areas of conflict around the world, particularly in
the Middle East. The Soviet Union should be challenged to fulfill that declara-
tion before the West agreed to go forward on another declaration, viz., that
foreseen following the European Security Conference summit, which would
be especially sought by Brezhnev as a capstone to his career and a prelude to
the twenty-fifth Communist party congress in February.
Finnish and British participants were not sure that the Russians were all
that interested in "buying" a Security Conference summit with other conces-
sions, such as about the ~fiddle East. They had already largely achieved their
principal aim of putting an end to expectations of change in Eas~e:n Euro~e.
Was it not unrealistic to expect them to pay a substantial additwnal pnce
just for a summit declaration? All the same, countered other speakers, there
was no reason for us not to drag our feet and put them on the spot. They
might refuse to cooperate, but at least their attitude would have been made
evident.

conflict on the periphery was seen as part of a new Sonct strategy winch was
concentrating on political weaknesses in such \\'estern centers as Italy, France,
Portugal and Spain ("the general crisis of c~pitalism:'). Th_e speaker consc-
uently foresaw a conciliatory Soviet attitude m the :\l1ddle East.
q This analysis was supported by a British par_ticipant, but a ~·renchman t_ook
issue with it. With their resolute and unyieldmg \vays, he s~ud, the Russians
were managing to impose their views everywhere, while they wert~ busy builc~ing
up an unprecedentedly strong naval force. \Vhy should they be mterrstrd Ill a
peaceful settlement in the Middle East?
An Italian also saw no evidence of the Russians' willingness to rrnounce
their intention of restoring their influence in the :\Iiddle East, including the
Persian Gulf. This speaker went on to say that any :\lid-East settlcmrnt would
have to begin with a validation of the moderate forces in both the :\rab and
Israeli camps.
Another Italian challenged the contention that the Sm·iets wen· now
aiming to upset the balance in Europe. They were being kept too busy with
their troubles with the East European Communist parties. The :\mrrican
speaker replied that he had not meant to suggest that the Sm·iets hoprd to
break up the Western alliance. It was rather that they sought to promotr dr-
composition in the West wherever possible. Although they were now passing
into a phase of great-power aspirations and achie\Tments, they would takr
care to act prudently.
The role of Europe itselfin any Middle Eastern settlement was the subjrct of
several interventions. An Irish participant concedrd that there was as yrt no
single "European viewpoint", and that some member countries were frankly
more pro-Israel than others. Nonetheless, he detected enough shared ,·jew-
points to suggest that a common European policy should be s~ught.
Other participants thought that this would be pointless. An International
speaker, supported by a Frenchman, said that Europe would not in the near
future be able either to deploy weaponry or to gi,·e political guarantees in the
Middle East.
Several speakers - French, American and International - were persuaded
~hat European.interests could nevertheless fill an important post-settlement role

Arabs for business reasons. :\ny one cuuntry's resolution to draw the line
somewhere could be undercut by otlwr cuuntries' not respecting it. The
Netherlands was one of the kw ll<ltions, he said, which had drawn the line in
1973 and stuck by it, dcmon'>tr<lting <I great deal of political courage. The
speaker said that his gcnnation h<HI not t·xperienccd ~lunich, but had read
enough about it to be horrified by the idea of acceding to a boycott.
The 1973 crisis - with its enormous military and economic threats - had
attenuated Europcan-:\nwricu1 JTLltions, largely as a result of poor commu-
nications,accordin!!: to an Irish and an International participant. But European
attitudes about the ).liddk East had "gruwn up" since rg67, a fact perhaps
not fully understood by the .-\mnicans.
An Italian said that if Europe still seemed self-centered, it was not that it
preferred to leaH all responsibility to the CS, but that it was preoccupied
with safeguarding its own fragile unity.
While an lntt"rnational speaker found apparently little residue of resentment
in Europe about America's behaYior in 1973, an Irish participant said that a
question hung in the air: Did the existence of NATO really imply that Eur~pe
had a "duty" to follow the CS eHry time the Americans judged that vrtal
interests were at stake?

A Turkist participant reported that some E~ro~eans e~visag~d ha\"ing to
lobby directly with the CS Congress, or n·c·n with Its constttuenctes. .
According to a British speaker, there had been talk :tt a rece~t meetmg of
the Council of Europe of the need f(H· increased sclf-rcltancc, whtle some ~ad
gone so far as to suggest putting out feelers about possiblc_Eur?pean neutrality.
On the other hand, said an Italian, thcrr was a feclmg m some quarters
that there had been no fundamental change in Europe's attitude towards
America. Since, in Soviet eyes, the CS had suffered a major defeat in Vietnam,
a Norwegian participant thought that it was now more important than c\·er
for Europeans to reassure the l'S of their loyalty to the alliance..
To one American, Europeans in general seemed to lack a feelmg of respon-
sibility for events. It might not be too much to say that a creative impulse
about its own responsibilities was missing from Europe. \\.hilc Europeans were
prepared to leave things to the Americans, many expressed doubts about the
US security commitment to Europe and about l'S domestic colwsion.
There was a strong l\Tarxist ftav01· to much of European university teaching
about current affairs in the US, which the speaker illustrated by citing the
titles of courses offered at the Free l!ni\-crsitv of Berlin. This meant that a
new generation of Europeans was growing up ~vhich might not feel that all of
us in the Atlantic community were "in the same boat''.
Several Americans commented on current attitudes in their country towards
foreign commitments. One of them sensed a definite trend towards isolationism,
a tendency to downgrade questions of security, alliances, the UN. He felt
that a "prolonged effort of creative leadership" on the part of the Europeans
and the Japanese was now needed to inspire the American Congress and
public opinion.
Another American wondered whether the relentless criticism of US policies
had not finally so blurred the distinction between the values of free and collec-
tivist societies that the Americans would be unable to make a heroic effort if
challenged. A Norwegian had the same question about young people in
Europe.
Other speakers thought there was no doubt about the determination of the
A~erican people to fulfill their commitments in the world. A US participant
pomted out that the NATO treaty had been ratified after a clear explanation
to the public that it would give the president power to deploy US troops without
further authorization from Congress. One of the major points of contention
about the Vietnam war, which had caused such divisiveness in America was
that it had been pursued without proper Congressional approval. Th: end
of tha~ war might well enable the US to give better attention to its commit-
ments mother parts of the globe, including Europe.
..........______________l
It was true all th~ same that a process of change was under way in Washing-
ton to redrtss the balance of power in tht: conduct of foreign affairs. As one
'CS participant put it, the president was meant to be the architect but it was
up to the Congress to supply the bricks and mortar, a diYision of labor that
bad been overlook~d in rcccnt wars.
Another American particiiJant suggested that the pendulum had now
swung too far in the other direction, as exemplified by the Congressional ban
on arms aid to Turkey. He {·haracterized that action as harmful to NATO
and the US, potentially helpful to the CSSR, and non-productive of the goal
its proponents allegedly had in mind, namely, the resolution of the Cyprus
crisis.
The speaker was not sure himself exactly where the balance should be
struck as between the exccutiH and the legislature; a greater interest in the
problem had recently grown up among the public, and the people would
eventually set the degree of readjustment. \Vhat seemed likely, though, was
that the present mood would not be definitive. The new Congress, in the wake
ofVietnam and \Vatergate, had exhibited traces of an "anti-everything" spirit.
When the "rib cage" of leadership eventually formed- that had not happe~ed
yet - the Congress would be able to respond to the public's dissatisfactwn
with the status quo.
But in the meantime, Europeans were counseled not to wring their hands
in anguish about the "credibility of the US commitment". If a real threat. to
Europe emerged, there was no doubt in the speaker's mind that Amenca
would respond quickly. There was no real alternative for the us. - ?r for
Europe- unless one believed that detente was equivalent to peace, whtch It was
not.

as a latent sore which erupted \·iolen tly from ti.mc to time. The principal
components of the present conflict wcTc Cyprus and the Aegean, and a German
participant advocated a compromise whneby the Turks might yield on Cyprus
and the Greeks on the Aegean. Perhaps the EC - full membership of which
both countries aspired to - could be helpful in prm·iding a f.1ct-finding com-
mission, a channel of communication and a meeting ground.
A Turkish speaker replied that Cyprus and the Aegean were completely
separate issues, and that it was like mixing apples and oranges to talk of a
joint solution. Although the arms race was debilitating to the economy of
both sides, Turkey could not afford to let her defense arrangements remain
suspended while NATO decided what to do.
Two compatriots added these points: that the issue in Cyprus involved the
very existence of the state, which had been created by treaty and was sui
generis; that the Turks were still counting on Greek willingness to negotiate;
and that the US arms embargo was not only harmful to NATO but counter-
productive. It was unfortunate that this regional dispute had been blamed for a
deterioration in NATO relations. In Turkish eyes, American credibility had
b:en much more damaged by the US reaction to the Cyprus affair than by the
Withdrawal from Vietnam.
~s to the general state ofNATO, an American participant observed that the
alhanc: had worked reasonably well in handling things which the member
countnes had agreed to do together, which they had planned for, and which
they had persuaded their publics about. The Middle East had unfortunately
not been on the NATO agenda.
But the world had changed since that agenda had been drawn up, and it
was ti~e for it to be broadened to CU\Tr relationships with nations outside
the alliance. ?n severa_l ~ccasions since 1~li3, Secretary Kissinger had proposed
closer Atlann~ cooperation on a broader Ltnge of issues; it had not been US
reluctance wh1ch .had slowed that inn·itabk step.
Anothe~ Amencan suggested, howe\Tr, that the current stvle of US diplo-
:"Y•whiCh f~vorc<l top-to-top cathn than middk-hcl c~multation,, had
.een ~n 1mped1mcnt and should be discarded in fayor of a return to "institu-
twnahzed foreign policy."
. An Irishman in turn obsen-ed that Europe was slow to talk frankly because
lt seemed that the CS was constrained -by current events or the constitutional
pr?cess- t~ ~ammer out agreed positions different from Europe's own precon-
