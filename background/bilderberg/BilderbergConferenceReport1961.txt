INTRODUCTION
The tenth Bilderberg Conference met at St-Castin near Quebec on 21
22
and 23 April 1961. It was the first time the conference was held in Can~a.
The previous meetings have been held in the Netherlands, France, Germany,
Denmark, Italy, the United Kingdom, Turkey, Switzerland and in !he
United States.
Seventy-two persons from twelve different countries attended. The United
States and Canada were strongly represented, the United States by twenty-two
and Canada by sixteen persons.
It is not the purpose of these conferences to attempt to make policy or to
recommend action by governments. The sole object of these meetings is to
reach a better understanding of prevailing differences between the Western
countries and to study those fields in which agreement may be sought. To
reach this aim men ofoutstanding qualities and influence are brought together
in circumstances where discussions can be frank and where arguments not
always used in public debate can be put forward.
The discussions are so organized as to permit a broad and frank exchange of
views to take place. They are held in conditions ofstrict privacy and neither
the press nor observers are admitted. No resolutions are passed and no state-
ments have to be approved by the participants who are free to draw theirown
conclusions from the discussions.
Those invited to attend the Bilderberg Meetings are chosen from different
nations and from all fields ofpublic activity and include politicians and states-
men, diplomats, businessman, intellectuals and leaders of public opinion. All
participants attend these meetings in a purely personal capacity and the views
they c:Jg>ress are their own and do not necessarily represent those ofthe organi-
zations or parties to which they belong.
The various items on the agenda are mostly introduced by rapporteurswho
have prepared papers on these subjects. The documents are as far as possible
circulated in advance of the meetings.
The agenda of the tenth Bilderberg Conference ran as follows:
1. What initiatives are required to bring about a new sense in leadership and
direction within the Western Community?
a. The role ofN.A.T.O. in the world policy of the member countries.

I. WHAT INITIATIVES ARE REQ.Ulll.ED
TO BRING ABOUT A NEW SENSE OF LEADERSHIP
AND DIRECTION WITHIN THE
WESTERN COMMUNITY?
In opening the meeting, H.R.H. the PriDce ofthe Nethetlanck thanked the
Canadian hosts for their hospitality, and especially Cor choosing so pleasant
a meeting-place.
He went on to apeak ofMr. Rctingcr, the group's honorary secretary, who
had died shortly atb:r the previoua meeting, and $aid that the BUclerberg
Meetings had owed a great deal to his efForts.
The President began bygiving the ftoor to a Canadian participant, whom he
invited to make some introductory remarks on item 1 aa a whole. The speaker
put his arguments in a. deh"bcrately ''provocative" form, in order to stimulate
discussion.
How would we go about it, he asked, ifthe N.A.T.O. Treaty had to be re-
written in 1g61? Circumstances bad changed greatly and the mgaaization
badhadto adaptitselfinconsequence. Weshouldsee whether ithadsucceeded
in this.
In 1949, when the Soviet threat to Ew:ope became appal"C!lt, the West had a
monopolyofatomicweapons, whereas, in 1961, there was a deadlockdueto the
~ence of atomic forces. Furthermore, the Soviet threat now went far
beyondthelimitsofEurope, and was particula.rly apparentin Asiaand AJiica,
areas that did not give very much cause for alarm when N.A.T.O. was set up
u1 years ago. Although, during that peri~ Europe had recovered its spirit
and i1a faith, the geographical and other limitations of N.A.T.O.'s termS of
reference were increasingly obvious.
Moreover, the attitudeofcertainmembers oftheAlliance was determinedby
various directives which made it, in the speaker's own words, "pro-Atlantic in
Paris but not in New York". By this, he referred to the growing importance of
colonial questions, which led certain members to attach a priority to their
~don in this respect before the United Nations, a position that it was ever
harder to reconcile with that which they adopted towards some of their

formulate a policy, when, at the same time, the weakest position had to be
adopted in order to content everyone? The development of~estructure ofthe
United Nations, now that it had so many new members, obliged us t~ depend
moreon N.A.T.O.; for this purpose,theAlliance must hemade tofunction more
effectively and rapidly. This was a most urgent matter.
It was also cenain that the work ofeducating public opinion with re~ to
the threat from the East had been insu.fficie~t, and that those respons1ble for
public opinion would have to do more tn this respect. . . .
In conclusion, the speaker said that, inst~d of concemmg ttsdf With the
short-term interests of member states, the Alliance would have to develop a
wider, long-term policy which would he in the interests ofall.
In the course of the discussion which followed these statements many
speakers mentioned the difficulties caused by the evolution of ~e world
situation as compared with N--\.T.O.'s initial mission. StresS~ l~d ':'<'th on
methods ofmaking the most ofthe existing framework and ofWidemng rt. The
role ofthe United Nations was discussed in this respect, especially with regard
to possibledifferences ofopinion amongits Western members. The functio~g
ofthe Alliance naturally led to an examination ofthe part played by Amencan
leadashipandalsooftheideadescnDed - too hastily, perhaps -as the setting up
ofa "three power directorate". With regard to American leadership, many
speakers mentioned the recent events in Cuba and their effects on the position
ofthe United States in the world.
The question ofotherinstitutions was also raised, in the light ofthe new tasks
facing the Western countries to-day, and especially that ofassistance to under-
developed countries. It was only touched upon at this stagein the debate, as its
economic aspect was to be thoroughly examined under item 2 of the agenda.
However, several participants raised the question of whether or not N.A.T.O.
could be used in this connection.
Several speakers expressed synthetic views which may be taken as reflecting
the opinion of the vast majority ifnot ofall those present.
A participant who had been one ofthe group ofseven who drafted the text of
the North Atlantic Treaty recalled that, in 1949, the world-wide nature ofthe
Communist threat was not obvious to everyone; on the contrary, it seemed
then to beconcentrated on Europe. Care had to be taken not to go beyond the
limits acceptable to national public opinions, and therefore to the Parliaments
called upon to rarifY the Treaty. This had led to a very precise geographical
definition of the area in which an attack on one of the partners was to be
considered as an attack on all. Even then, the possibility ofmutual consultation
on questions arising outside that area had not been excluded.
12
At the sllll;'e time, ~ere had been the problem of the Treaty's compatibility
Wlth the Uruted Nations Charter under Article 51, but, in order to make the
Treaty more acceptable to world public opinion, its Article 2 had been intro-
duced. dealing with non-military cooperation within the Alliance.
Thus, as other speaken had confirmed, N.A.T.O. was a geographically
limited response to a threat that had become world-wide. How could its fic1d
ofactivity be widened? Ifthe need for this, which was stressed most forcibly by
-.
a French participant, were recognized, itseemed difficult to bring it about by a
modification of the Treaty because, as a Canadian and an American speaker
pointed out, some ofthe amendments that would probably besuggested would
not, at the present time, be accepted by the various Governments and Parlia-
ments. However, said one speaker, the geographical difficulty could be re-
duced by increasing the cooperation announced by Mr. Spaak. between
N.A.T.O., C.E.N.T.O. and S.E.A.T.O. Geographically, some thought the
United Nations the most appropriate framework; but when it came to the
subjects to be discussed. other organizations seemed more appropriate in some
cases. These two points will be examined later in detail.
Several speakers stressed the numerous opportunities for comultation offered
by the Treaty. But how was this to be conducted? Should it be confined to a
simple exchange ofviews, or should it aim at a complete unity ofviews (and of
action) resulting in a common position, within the United Nations, for ex-
ample? In other words, could the members ofthe Alliance afford to disagree on
certain problems, and to show their disagreement to the world at large?
One participant, who represents his country within N.A.T.O., thought that
this question could be usefully clarified if pains were taken to classify the
problems that arose in three categories:
- those for which common action was possible;
- those for which, in the absenceofcommon action, a certain harmonizationof
the actions of each partner was possible;
- those for which "the right to disagree" should be granted.
In each case, he pointed out, the matter could always be viewed from a
positive standpoint, that is to say that each government could do its best to
hinder its partners as little as possible. Experience showed, be added, that this
was not a mere pious hope.
A British participant went even further, and thought that it might be of
advantage to the Alliance ifits members did not adopt a monolithic atittude
with respect to certain international questions. Thus, he said - taking as
examples the Suez affair and the recent events in Cuba- N.A.T.O. would
avoid giving the uncommitted countries the impression ofbeing a coalition of
interests some of which it was difficult to defend.
I
a
Although, as a Belgian participant pointed out, it was beco~g harder ~nd
harder, and indeed impossible, to determine a world poUc:y Wlthin the Umted
Nations, because the latter had become a theatre for pa!lion, the N.A.T.O.-
U.N.O. dilemma should not be solved to the detriment ofthe latter organiza-
tion. Several participants agreed with this; one, a Canadian, thought that the
historical development of his country enabled it to exercise, within the U.N.,
an inBucncc that was favourable to the very values that N.A.T.O. defended.
Another thought that, although it would be difficult formally to set up a
"N.A.T.O. group" within the United Nations, one might wish that there be
more "private" discussion between members of the Alliance, mainly in order
to obtain foreknowledge ofthe positions that each was to adoptin the coUl'lle of
important debates, thus avoiding mistakes. He added that thefuture evolution
of the United Nations Organization, as a result of the modifications it had
und~ne during the pastfew years, should be the subjectofa serious examina-
tion by the members ofthe Atlantic Community.
The discussion ofthese questions was dosely linked with that ofthe scheme
for an "Atlantic Directorate", rightlyor wrongly attributed to the Government
of the French Republic. A participant from that country forcibly stated that
thisexpression had beeninvented by thosewho wereenemies ofthescheme, and
that it was merely a matter ofrecognizing that some members ofthe Alliance
had wider responsibilities than others, which should mean that, in the interests
ofthe West i13elf; they should play a more important role in the discussion of
certain international questions. A Canadian participant said that, after
hearingthe explanation, there was still question ofa "directorate" whether the
word was used or not. Several others, mast of them from small countries,
stated that there could be no question, for them, ofpurelyandsimply accepting
deci.Uons taken by others, and that this was all the more true when it came to
situations in which they had no responsibility at all. Further, as two of them
said, this idea could be harmful to the Alliance, both on account ofthe psycho-
logical opposition it could raise and the difficulties it could cause in the func-
tioning of the Alliance, there being no mechanism for "weighting", such as
existed in some parliamentary systems. Two European speakers also thought
that there was only one great power in the Alliance; and this view raised the
problem of"leadership", on which several participants spoke.
What is this leadership? One speaker attempted to give a definition, while
admitting that it was insufficient: the leader, he said, was the country which:
r) fully endorsed all commitments resulting from the commonly-defined
policyofN.A.T.O. and
!l) expressed this respoJllibility by taking decisions rapidly and, if need be,
without neceasariJy waiting for its partners to act.
I
Another participant considered that the partners' confid · th lead
'aJ ofl d . ence m e er
was an essena ea ership; from this point ofview N A.T o 'al
fc • d · • · · . wasallpCCl
case, or, m a emocrauc regime, the leader is replaced if confid · hi
disa h 'thin • ence m m
ppears, w creas, wt • the Atlantic :AJliance, there was no other country
that couldreplace the Umtcd States. This being so as a Canadian · ·
'd, t f th . . , 1 ' paruapant
18.1 mos o e cnttCl&m evelled at the United States was superficial, and it
would be absurd t?~ct the l~er to~ perfect, especially in the light ofhis
enormous respODSJbilitic:s. Within the Alliance, thelcadenhip wouldalways be
s~gthened by close coordination between the measures taken· under its
gmdance, the Alliance should give the impression of advancing ~ong paths
that have been generally agreed by its memben.
Many speakers mentioned the recent events in Cuba in connection with the
problem of American leadership. A British participant thought the action of
t?e U_nited States had been most harmful to the Western position, particularly
smce 1t had destroyed part ofthe advantages acquired during the fint weeks of
the Kennedy administration with regard to Asia, Africa, Latin America and
even Europe. This impression had been heightened, he said, by the fact that
thegovernmenthad,onthisoccasion,insisted on thedefence ofpurelyAmerican
interests, thus stressing the idea of a sphere of influence within which the
United States assumed the right to overthrow governments of which they dis-
approved. This was contrary to two provisos ofthe United Nations Charter of
which one forbade the use offorce in the defence ofa purely national pollcy
and the other intervention in the internal affairs ofother States. The fact tha~
the U.S.S.R. had broken these rules on several occasions only made it more
necessary for us to be irreproachable in this respect. The speaker accepted the
leadership ofthe United States, but said that theyshould give proofofpolitical
and military wisdom. He felt quite free to express this view, as he had been
against his own government's position at the time ofthe Suez afFair.
This strong and frank speech gave rise to several replies by Americans and
Europeans. Oneshould notforget, theysaid, that communistinfluenceinCuba
wasin~daily, nor that theintensive armingofthe Cubans bythe Eastern
countries was a danger that had nothing mythical about it. It was not so much
a danger for the United States in themselves, as for the Latin American
republics with which they were associated in the Organization of American
States, whose firm and unequivocal stand against communism at the last
conference at San Jos~ had caused the Cuban delegation to leave the hall.
Finally, the instigators of the recent events were Cubans, some of whom had
been convinced followers ofCastro. Immobilism, said severalofthese speakers,
would have been even more disastrous, in the light of the deterioration of
Western positions elsewhere in the world.
In all)' event, a European participantseemed to haftezpreacd the pneral
feeJiDg whenhe said that c:onsultadon between theAllia had betm iuaulficient
mthis cue, as it had been m the put at the time ofSua; h was therefore
DeCCISiliY to institute, withm the Alliant:et a common QBJIIination of'questions
which would not only iDc:lude Europe and Alia. but also Afiica and Latin
America. Itwas lessand less possibletoapeakofprivateareasof'iDfluence.
A problem which alsointerested the meeting was thatoftypes ofcooperation
between Western natious which were not directly coDncctcd with military
considerations. The idea that N.A.T.O.'s action should be Umitcd to its
military.function was in no wayshared byanotherEuropeanapcab::r <-econded
by an American participant), who thought that N.A.T.O. would deteriorate
unless itsmembersreachedagreementonbasicpoliticalandeconomicproblems.
Sewral speakers wondered whether certain fiesh. initiatM:s, such as assistance
to undeJ'odeveloped countries, could not be taken under Article !2 ofthe North
Atlantic Treaty. On the whole, speakers to this pointshowed a pn:fcrcnce for
the newly-created institutions, such as the O.E.c.D. andthe D.A.G., pointing
out that their intervention would dcpolitic:ize certain problems, the more so
as five non-Atlantic countries belonged to the organization mentioned. This
would not prevent, said one participant, these questions &om being previously
ctiacusBed.m10D1CcasesinN.A.T.O., whosemaintaskwould betoexaminetheir
poHtical implications. Another apcakcr said that there were important
economic conditions raulting from N.A.T.O.'s military policy, and that these
would have to be discussed, especially as far as cost-sharing was conccmcd.
Another participant thought that it was not inconceivable that a proportion
might be worked out between the military burden bome by each partner and
m. contribution to other schemes, such as assistance, so that the sum ofthese
contributioDS would be taken into account when it came to cost-sharing.
No participant argued that there was a contradiction between theexistence
ofN.A.T.O. and that of the O.E.C.D. On the contrary, a European apcakcr
ICCIDI to have reflected the general view in streaing that the ever-increasing
intcrpeDetration ofWcstcrn economies, of'which the O.E.c.D. was the visible
sign, Wiiicituted the only solid and durable basis for a reinfon:cment of the
military cohellion ofN.A.T.O.
B. THE B.OLE AND CONTB.OL
OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS WITHIN N.A.T.O.
The discuslion ofthis item was based, on the one hand, on a technical note
fiom an authoritative IIOUrCC and, on the other, on an article by one of the
16
American participants that had recently appeared in FOUJON ADAJU und
the ode: "Nuclear Sharing: N.A.T.O. and theN I country". cr
The notebeganbyrecalling thedccisiOJIStaken afterthe meetingofthe heads
ofN.A.T.O. governments at the end of 1957: in the light ofincreased Soviet
nuclear potential and the unilateral attitude ofthe Russians in tbia field, there
was to be ~ted the most cfticient and modem defensiveforce poaible,while.
at the same time, nuclear warheads were to be stockpiled and the Supreme
A1liec:l Commander Europe (S.A.C.E.U.R..) was to be given medium-range
ballistic missiles. From that time on, considerableprogress badbeen achieved.
especially with regard to equipping the Allied Forces with launching-devices.
The general mission of the Atlantic Forces was to diacouragc agg.rcsDon
(..dctetrcnce"); one of the main deterrents c:onaistcd in those Forces' reprisal-
potential.
Another deterrent was the ao-called "Shield Forces", made up of soldiers,
sailors and airmenfrom thefourteen S.A.C.E.U.R..countries. Itbadalsobeen
deemed necessary to set up nuclear units to be associatedwith these conven-
tionally-armed N.A.T.O. troops.
In the event ofaggression, however minorit mightbe, the role ofthe Shield
was to impose a halt that would force the enemy to amplify theincident ifhe
wished totum the afWrinto a Dllf:iorwar. Thesecondrole oftheShieldwasto
protect populations and territories. Its third role waa to support the Westem.
reprisal-potential, cspccially by enabling this to be adapted to the size ofthe
attack.
Improvements in conventional weapons carried outsimultaneously withthe
nuclear equipping of the Atlantic forces corresponded to two main ideas:
I) basic combat units must be organized, trained and equipped so that they
could normally react, in the event of an incident, by means of c:omnmtional
weapons, 2) however, if nuclear weapons bad to be used in the fighting, the
level ofdecision would have to be a high one, and the usc ofthl:sc weapons
could only result from a deliberate decision, taken at a level laid down in
N.A.T.O. directives and plans. In any event, this level would ~ to be
situated above that ofthe commanders ofbasic combat units.
In order to meet this double requirement, the need for the IntrnnediaU:
Range Ballistic Missile (I.R.B.M.) was rcc:ognjzed in 1957· The Jupiter
missiles now being put into service met this need up to a certain point. The
uscofPolaris missileswas understudy, anditwas hopedtosetuphighlymobile
land or naval units equipped with theseweapons by rg6s;-55· The mod~
tion programme extended until 1970; even by that date, 1twas not ccrtaiD that
piloted aircraft would be entirely replaced by misiles.
As for control of these weapons, a distinction had to be drawn between
launching-devicesand nuclear warheads, the latter remaining in the custody of
the countty which made or owned them, and only beingissued to the combat
units when the situation warranted and after decuion at a high level.
The note recalled a recent speech by General orstad on the subject of a
greater centralization ofnuclear control within N.A.T.O. The General stressed
the difficulty ofreconciling the increasingdesire ofthe countries ofthe Alliance
to participate in control with the need for the Alliance to be able to make
effective use ofnuclear weapons ifthe need arose. Whilestatingthathe had no
wish to propose a definite solution to a problem that was, above all, political,
the Supreme Commander Europe said that he would not recommend any
system which resulted in an addition to the number ofnations or authorities
holding nuclear warheads, any more than he would subscn"be to anyfilcilitation
or encouragement ofthe independent research, improvement or productionof
nuclear weapons.
"However", said General Norstad,"it cannot be assumed thatthecreation of
a multinational atomic authority, making N.A.T.O. a fourth atomic power, as
it has been expressed, would necessarily inftuence the desire ofsome nations to
pursue their own independent quest for an atomic weapons capability. How-
ever, such action might very well satisfy the desire and interests of others by
meeting fully the military requirements, and by assuring an essentially equal
voice in the control oftheparticular pool ofwarheads which could be establish-
ed as essential to the direct defense ofEurope".
At the beginning ofthe article in FoREIGN .AnAIRS, already mentioned, the
author asks: "Is the spread ofstrike nuclear forces good or bad? When we
regard the diffusion ofnuclear weapons as bad or at least worrisome, we refer to
it as the Nth power problem. In this guise, it appears as the chiefjustification
fur arms control and especially for a test-ban". It seems, in the present state of
affairs, that United Statespolicyfollows two lines, one ofwhich holds that itis a
bad idea to increase the number of nuclear powers, while the other seems to
hold the contrary belie£ On the one hand, there are the clauses ofthe Atomic
Energy Law, which forbid the communication ofatomic secrets to the allies of
the United States themselves; on the other, certain facets of American policy
seem to indicate an opposite tendency, such as the "double control" ofmissiles
based in foreign countries, the poasibllity oftechnical assistance in the building
of French and Dutch atomic submarines (this being limited, however, to the
non-nuclear parts of the machinery), the cooperation granted to the United
Kingdom after the modification~ made to the Atomic Energy Act in I 958
(which gready encouraged the other allies, and especially France, to proceed
J8
along the !lllme lines) a~d finally, the present project, which was intended to
transfer a whole strategic nuclear system into the hands of N.A.T 0
Jut cue, itwas the word "shanng", with all its moral overto ~ • In this
Although these two lines ofpolicy seem diametncally op n~ twas used.;
___.,_~ di · · h poate, they are not
""'un;~y vergent: 1t mtg t be said that the United States are read to lace
nuclear weapons at the disposal ofsome of their allies but that the:rer!e to
supp~y; ~em to other allies, to neutrals and to hostil: powers. Kowever, the
':cqwsttion at: tbc;se weapons.by certain of America'• allic:a might favour a
similar extensJon m the oppclllte or the neutral camps, which it precisely what
should be avoided.
In the present political context, says the author, the time baa come to decide
whether the United States it concerned over the Nth pow1:r problem, or
~~er it is in favour ofdiffusion and the world situation to which that may
gtve nse.
On this score, opinions in the United States differ: there are the petsimitu
(to whom the author feels drawn) who fear an era in which there could be a
dangerous multiplication of nuclear powers, and the optimisu, who believe
that such a multiplication would militate against the use of nuclear weapollS.
A third school, believing that such a process is inevitable, hopes that the
United States will cooperate in order to reduce the financial burden unpoeed
upon their allies by the cost ofnuclear equipment.
The author points out that all these schools ofthoughtlack precisionin their
forecasts, especially with regard to the number and skill ofthe countries that
mightbecome"nuclear". He hopes thatany"Nthcountry" thatisa member of
N.A.T.O., even ifit only considers its own interests, will realize that itl efforts
run the risk ofbeing not only arduous, but disappointing However, from the
standpointofworld stability, the Nth country tends to consider the problemas
thatofthe "N+I-country": the third-power problemfor the UnitedStatesand
the SovietUnion, thefourth powerfor the United Kingdom, the fifth powerfor
France, and so on. It is surprising that the leaders of the two latter countries
should have described their attemptJ at nuclear armament as filvourable to
future disarmament agreements.
From the standpoint of their national interests, the European countries in
N.A.T.O. may ask themselves the following questions. What sort ofnuclear
capability are the lesser industrial powers in the West likely to ~? What
are the motivations for achieving independent capabilities? What JS the role
ofthe American nuclear guarantee? Is it, as it is currently fashionable to say,
"incredible"?
The author then examines the four main positions open to the Western
Powers:

II. THE IMPLIOATIO S POll WISTERN' UNITY
OF CHANGES IN THE R.ELATIVE .ECONOMIC
STRE GTH 011' THE UNITED STATBS
AND WESTERN EUR.OP-'
The sulUect was introduced by two wodiDgpapers. onetty a UidtedStates
participant who, after ha'91Dg heeD a publicofticial. now hOlda a high-ranking
postin industry, aDd theother by an international pa.rtldpmt, the h'ead ofone
ofthe great world economic institutions.
The very dramatic change in the relative positiolll ofth'e Ulifted Sfates and
other industrial countries can be seen &om the following figmes. during the
threeyears 1958-6o,industrial countries otherthan th~ UnitedStatalincieased
their reserves ofgold and dollaJs by more than hal£ 'I'hie was iDah:ily the
counterpartofdefid.ts incurred bythe United Statesinitsbalanceofpayments,
which amounted to I s-5 billionin 19s8.S s.sbillionin 1959oandSs.8biJliop.
in 1g6o. In these three years, the United States' gold stock was reducred by
I 4-8 mDlion, while U.S. short-term dollar Habilities toforeigners inc:reuedby
1 &.s billion.
It should be said that the two reports reach the same conclusions in many
casea. Then: is little divergence between them, only a dift'erence ofstress as
repnls one ICt offiwtoD rather than another.
Forinstance, both p<!int out that the economic recovery ofWestern Europe
&om 1945onwanfshasptogreslivelyraluced the continent'sdependenceon the
United States, and has by now Jed, as one ofthem stressed, tosomethingquite
clolelymembling the pattern ofthe immediate pre-war world. Thisis notan
automaticpxocess, buta rault ofcommercial andfinanCialpolicies adoptedby
the European governments.
BefOre the war, the ind.Uitrial production ofthe United States was roughly
equal to thatofWescanEuropeandJapan. In If*7, U.S.induatrialproduction
was more than twice that ofWestern Europe andJapan,-and even in xg.t.S it
was some 75°o pater. By Ig6o. industrialproductioninWestern Europe and
Japan was about xso% higher thau in r!J48, whileproductionin the U.S. was
only 6o% above tfHS. Evenso, the industrialproduction ofthe United States

The two rapporteurs pxaented to the audience the oWn Unes of their
reports the discussion which foUowecli'UigCd <M:r a Wlde field.
A European participant, whose poilldon made lWit ~ ~ aa
regards .intematicmaJ settlements, pointed out that ccmslclcrabht progrees had
recently been acbiev.:d .in cooperation between central biuW on either side of
the Atlantic. Contacts between baob bad been .intensified morder to avoid
the possible consequmce ofunforeseen c:Ustordon .in interest-rates Even when
this cooperation did not lead to iOnDal decisions, the cxc:J:wJies of views
.involv.:d took place .in a spirit of freedom and Jranbeas which eoa:bled both
sides to understand the otherman's problems and mod&, an\:\to take them into
account.
This cooperation was fiar from being m.erely tecbnical~ it Will poUtical and
psychologicaJ inits.sip.ificanc:e. Itwasno bad thingthattheUnited Statesand
Canada should bave "come down from their pedeatal", to cooperate on an
equal fuottng with their European partners in the O.E.C.D. ~~dence
between the two sides ofthe Atlantic was inaeasingl.y obvious, .ncJ tiUs was a
good thing. Many of the spcakeu mentioned this in~dence. and
wondered whether the partners drew all the poss1ole concluaions from its
existence.
A participant who bad recently assumed important international economic
n:sponsibiliticz said that the Atlantic partners should hencdbrtb abstain from
tating UDi.lateraJ measures with the thinly-veiled intention of"exporting their
difficulties", as is often the case when it came to devaluations. The purpc;~~e of
the O.E.C.D. was to reverse this tendency, by substituting common measures,
tal:en after consultation. for these egoistic attitudes. Some countries were able
to take effective measures; the n:cent revaluations ofthe mark and the florin
had been useful to the American and especially to the British balances. Simi-
larly, measures such as the lowering ofinterest-rates could stem the flow of
capital that weighed heavily on other countries. That was why, said an
American o.f1icia1, not only was it necessary to have an institutional association
ofthe Western countries as a fonun for the exchange ofviews, but also Cach
partner should seriously weigh the external effects of the monotary and fiscal
policies he intended to pursue.
The recent revaluation ofthe mark was cspecia.lly studied in this context; if;
contrary to what had often been said,it wasnot theresultofAmerican pressure
on the Federal Republican Government, it would appear, to use theexpression
ofa German participant who deplored the tact, tbat comiderations ofnational
economic policy (cspec:iaD.ywar-rata) had dictated its implementation. The
same speaker hoped that the wlues cLcurrencies would be made subject to
rigid rules, included,ifneed be,inconstitutional provisos In order to make uni-
34-
latcral~tionharder. AtthellU11CtiJDe.thelatitudeallowedto
by llhe.Charterofthe lnternatioul MonetaryPtmd (thefamous to%=
should be DIU'roWed. In any case.CODSnltatiOJll between centlal banJra should
precedeanyoperationofthis kind. However,there was always theriskthatthe
~cmall, who could agreefairly euily,would find thellllelves overruled'-
ti\C~r goyelmnents when they returned home. "T
~ the reasons for 1t, the German revaluation was welcomed by the
partiCipants, except for one, who stated that i1 had lbaken confidence m the
stability ofthe mark.
Other positive measures could be ta1cen. without waiting £or coiiiUltation,
mch as the case ofa CO'Uiltryin a strong poation that loweted itstarifbarrlen.
As for the nature and p.n~~p&.'11 ofthe American financial balance, several
speakers added points to therapporteurs' analysis. which raisedfew objcc:tiona.
Some ofthe EuropeaDS were.optimistic, one ofthem, for =ample; statingthat
the dcterloratian noted did not <:Olltain aay unhealthy elements this view
seems to be confirmed by the 6m lUtllts for rg6r, which lbow a positive
balance in favour of the United States), further, invemnents abroad coukl
provide an interesting source of rcvaue. Several speaken said a distinction
should be drawn bctwccn the tndc balance (which was not in peril , the
temporary ~ of payau:nts (which was c:enaiDly much iuluenccd by
spcculativc:lllCMmlents,anestimate.af'whichvarlmsHgbtlyamongthcspeakm,
but which. aa theysend, wereenly. dangerouaifthey coutinuedto be one-way
and thestructuralsituationof'the country underdisc:uslloo. In.tldatespect, an
American strased that it was the multiplicity and scope ofthe United State&
Government's commitments abroad that made the pcllitian wlnerabJe, and
this raised the problem, already mentioned by the xapportems, or a better
sb.aringofthe costsbetweenallies. A Memberof~ that,inthelight
of his country's difficulties, it would become increasingly ctiflicult, despite
constant education ofpubHc opinion, to get the latter to aarcc to fmei.gu aid
p~es unless it received the impression that Europe was doing moxe.
On the other hand, European spcakcm i:lt that IDCIIIUtCII such aa increued
taxing ofincome from foreign 10\lrCeSor the i'cduction ofcustoms ezcmptioDS
granted toAmaicans returning from abxo&dwould do moze harm than good.
for they attacked the ~ptoms and not the disease itsel£ One Emopean
criticized the official support given to campaignssuch aa ''BuyAmerican, Ship
American, FlyAmerican". AnQthersaid that circumstancesmight makethese
campaigus necessary, but that giving them ' durable c:bamc:tcr would be

There wu no well-dcfiDedWestern attitude to Soviet trade and atd. Given
the veryslightimportanceof'But-West trade, any cba.n,oo QfaUp.tlyin~
it was generally well rcceiwd. There was 1IIOl'C oppo11tioa to thfa trade in the

It was our task, said the rapporteur, to decide how to actin the&ee ofsuch
problems;in the lightofthe unfortunate attitudeofbusiness ciJcles.itwouldbe
better to reduce barrlcrs to East-West trade to the minimum compatible with
security, and to do openly what was now being done with an mgn.cc.
With regard toaid, therapponeurad.voc:atedthattheWestshouldproposeto

refused, the West would againhave theadvantageofhavingtaken theinitiatiVe

Despite Soviet prosress. the economic power and the experience ofthe ftee
world were certainly much greater. In these circumstances, the West should
inu:grateits aid to agreaterdegree, whkhwould certaiDlyplaceitona stronger

ANNEX B
Canadianpaper
P1aced ln a poeition which 1cada thetn to avoid the risk tXa world c:oaBict,
but encouraged by the rapidity or their own development, the Scmeta, un-
shakeable as everm thdrdetermination to dominatethe world, appearedtobe
t:ra.lllferring to civilian objectives the main accent oftheir strategy, \1IIUII trade
and aid as weapons.
Stq>s must be taken to oppose the suc:c:esa ofsuch a policy, wbicb was as
dangerous as nuclear WlUfare, and which was, m *t, one fiu:et ofthe Soviet
strategic complex.
The speaker men~oned 1953 as the first year m which this Soviet economic
offensivehad been apparent. Thefree world had anoverwbelmingsuperiOrity
in this fielq, butitwould have to make the necasarysacrifices and eft'orts in a
spirit ofunity, matcbiDg the communist monolith.
There would bea lQDg trialofstrength, ca.lHngfbrDlliDY qualititl,iududing
an exact appreciationofthe considerablestrength ofcommunism.
Several factors were involved in the conflict. In: the first plaee, 1t must be
remembered that the communist leaderswere notsupermen. and thatRussian
economic progtess was mainly due to certain dynamic ibrces rather than to
commumsm itself (e.g. the already considerable CCOilOIII1C power of Cllarlst
Russia).
Thehigh growth-ra.teofthe U.S.S.R.should not delude us. ItwastheICSUI.t
ofits presentstate ofdevelopment, which was greatly difretcntftom thatofthe
old industrial nations; and the examples ofJapan, Forlli()la and Western
Germany, since 1958• showed tbat other regimes could attain an evm higher
rate ofgrowth.
The rapporteur dwelt on these tai:tors because, he said. we should not ~ow
oum:lves to be.hypnotizedby thebeliefthatprogressis meluctably greaterm a
communist regime.
The annual growth ofthe Soviet economy over the past 8 or to years bad
been some 1% as opposed to some S0
o lbr the United States. ~greatestin-
crease had been in industrial produc;tion: to% as against 8-5°o m the Uaited
States. In many fields, the aims ofthe last seven-yearplan bad already been
overshot.

draw them graduallyinto the communist bloc by c:uttiug ~ if'p<aible, their

theaimwas to playa greater partin their trade, withoutexcludingthe idea of

'The bloc was apc:cially attracted by areas of temporary trouble (e.g. the
Soviet attitude towards Egypt over Suez, Icelaud over the fisheries dispute,
Burma over ill roads. not to mention the recent case ofCuba). The damage

nese peoples wen: comparable with tUt of the Americ:ans, the danger of a
c:oufJic:t would be gready reduced;
- we should not, however, opeu a path for the dilturbiDg trade practices of
commuaism. We should put into effect pracuaes oftegulation rather than of
prolu"bitiou, and we had sucha prepondei'IUlCII m world trade that we could do
this sucx:essiWly. The G.A.T.T. countries, which voluntarilyadhered to certain
disciplines, controlled 8o% ofworld trade. The ataU: monopolies used by the
Soviet bloc should not become our models;
- unity of purpose among the Western D&Uons waa essential if we were to
maintalJl normal C01J1IIICl'Cial practices, which theSovietbloc might well admit
ifthey were presented with enough fon:c; determination and cohesion;
- as the uncommitted under-developed countries were mainlyneutralist, they
bought their requirements on the best market: we must then:fore act towards
thosc countries in a generous, hDeral and disin.ten:sted fashion, granting them
our aid without attaching conditions to it.
Fmally, thespeaker appealed to the reflection, decision and c:onfidence ofthe
free countriesoftheworldinthe&.ctofthelong-term challengedirectedat them.
