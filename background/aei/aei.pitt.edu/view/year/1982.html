This plan also provides for the creation of a United Nations Fund to prepare for the repatriation of the workers and to arrange possible sources of alternative work. This naturally presupposes close cooperation between the countries which provide the labour force and these would form an association (Association of Home Countries of Migrants) with substantial negotiating powers in dealings with South Africa.
