<p>This letter was sent to Carly Fiorina, CEO of Hewlett Packard Corporation,
in response to a <a href="http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/execteam/speeches/fiorina/minnesota01.html">speech</a>
given by her on September 26, 2001.
</p><p>
</p><hr width="80%">
<p>November 7, 2001
</p><p>Carly Fiorina
<br>Hewlett-Packard
<br>3000 Hanover Street
<br>Palo Alto, CA 94304-1185
</p><p>Dear Madame Fiorina:
</p><p>It is with great interest that I read your speech delivered on September
26, 2001, titled "Technology, Business and Our way of Life: What's Next"
[sic]. I was particularly interested in the story you told at the end of
your speech, about the Arab/Muslim civilization. As an Assyrian, a non-Arab,
Christian native of the Middle East, whose ancestors reach back to 5000
B.C., I wish to clarify some points you made in this little story, and
to alert you to the dangers of unwittingly being drawn into the Arabist/Islamist
ideology, which seeks to assimilate all cultures and religions into the
Arab/Islamic fold.
</p><p>I know you are a very busy woman, but please find ten minutes to read
what follows, as it is a perspective that you will not likely get from
anywhere else. I will answer some of the specific points you made in your
speech, then conclude with a brief perspective on this Arabist/Islamist
ideology.
</p><p>Arabs and Muslims appeared on the world scene in 630 A.D., when the
armies of Muhammad began their conquest of the Middle East. We should be
very clear that this was a military conquest, not a missionary enterprise,
and through the use of force, authorized by a declaration of a Jihad against
infidels, Arabs/Muslims were able to forcibly convert and assimilate non-Arabs
and non-Mulsims into their fold. Very few indigenous communities of the
Middle East survived this -- primarily Assyrians, Jews, Armenians and Coptics
(of Egypt).
</p><p>Having conquered the Middle East, Arabs placed these communities under
a Dhimmi (see the book <font color="#990000">Dhimmi,</font> by Bat Ye'Or)
system of governance, where the communities were allowed to rule themselves
as religious minorities (Christians, Jews and Zoroastrian). These communities
had to pay a tax (called a <i>Jizzya</i> in Arabic) that was, in effect,
a penalty for being non-Muslim, and that was typically 80% in times of
tolerance and up to 150% in times of oppression. This tax forced many of
these communities to convert to Islam, as it was designed to do.
</p><p>You state, "its architects designed buildings that defied gravity."
I am not sure what you are referring to, but if you are referring to domes
and arches, the fundamental architectural breakthrough of using a parabolic
shape instead of a spherical shape for these structures was made by the
Assyrians more than 1300 years earlier, as evidenced by their archaeological
record.
</p><p>You state, "its mathematicians created the algebra and algorithms that
would enable the building of computers, and the creation of encryption."
The fundamental basis of modern mathematics had been laid down not hundreds
but thousands of years before by Assyrians and Babylonians, who already
knew of the concept of zero, of the Pythagorean Theorem, and of many, many
other developments expropriated by Arabs/Muslims (see <font color="#990000">History
of Babylonian Mathematics</font>, Neugebauer).
</p><p>You state, "its doctors examined the human body, and found new cures
for disease." The overwhelming majority of these doctors (99%) were Assyrians.
In the fourth, fifth, and sixth centuries Assyrians began a systematic
translation of the Greek body of knowledge into Assyrian. At first they
concentrated on the religious works but then quickly moved to science,
philosophy and medicine. Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Galen, and many others
were translated into Assyrian, and from Assyrian into Arabic. It is these
Arabic translations which the Moors brought with them into Spain, and which
the Spaniards translated into Latin and spread throughout Europe, thus
igniting the European Renaissance.
</p><p>By the sixth century A.D., Assyrians had begun exporting back to Byzantia
their own works on science, philosophy and medicine. In the field of medicine,
the Bakhteesho Assyrian family produced nine generations of physicians,
and founded the great medical school at Gundeshapur (Iran). Also in the
area of medicine, (the Assyrian) Hunayn ibn-Ishaq's textbook on ophthalmology,
written in 950 A.D., remained the authoritative source on the subject until
1800 A.D.
</p><p>In the area of philosophy, the Assyrian philosopher Job of Edessa developed
a physical theory of the universe, in the Assyrian language, that rivaled
Aristotle's theory, and that sought to replace matter with forces (a theory
that anticipated some ideas in quantum mechanics, such as the spontaneous
creation and destruction of matter that occurs in the quantum vacuum).
</p><p>One of the greatest Assyrian achievements of the fourth century was
the founding of the first university in the world, the School of Nisibis,
which had three departments, theology, philosophy and medicine, and which
became a magnet and center of intellectual development in the Middle East.
The statutes of the School of Nisibis, which have been preserved, later
became the model upon which the first Italian university was based (see
<font color="#990000">The
Statutes of the School of Nisibis</font>, by Arthur Voobus).
</p><p>When Arabs and Islam swept through the Middle East in 630 A.D., they
encountered 600 years of Assyrian Christian civilization, with a rich heritage,
a highly developed culture, and advanced learning institutions. It is this
civilization that became the foundation of the Arab civilization.
</p><p>You state, "Its astronomers looked into the heavens, named the stars,
and paved the way for space travel and exploration." This is a bit melodramatic.
In fact, the astronomers you refer to were not Arabs but Chaldeans and
Babylonians (of present day south-Iraq), who for millennia were known as
astronomers and astrologers, and who were forcibly Arabized and Islamized
-- so rapidly that by 750 A.D. they had disappeared completely.
</p><p>You state, "its writers created thousands of stories. Stories of courage,
romance and magic. Its poets wrote of love, when others before them were
too steeped in fear to think of such things." There is very little literature
in the Arabic language that comes from this period you are referring to
(the Koran is the only significant piece of literature), whereas the literary
output of the Assyrians and Jews was vast. The third largest corpus of
Christian writing, after Latin and Greek, is by the Assyrians in the Assyrian
language (also called Syriac; see <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14408a.htm">here</a>.)
</p><p>You state, "when other nations were afraid of ideas, this civilization
thrived on them, and kept them alive. When censors threatened to wipe out
knowledge from past civilizations, this civilization kept the knowledge
alive, and passed it on to others." This is a very important issue you
raise, and it goes to the heart of the matter of what Arab/Islamic civilization
represents. I <a href="http://www.aina.org/aol/peter/greek.htm">reviewed</a>
a book titled <font color="#990000">How Greek Science Passed to the Arabs</font>,
in which the author lists the significant translators and interpreters
of Greek science. Of the 22 scholars listed, 20 were Assyrians, 1 was Persian
and 1 an Arab. I state at the end of my review: "The salient conclusion
which can be drawn from O'Leary's book is that Assyrians played a significant
role in the shaping of the Islamic world via the Greek corpus of knowledge.
If this is so, one must then ask the question, what happened to the Christian
communities which made them lose this great intellectual enterprise which
they had established. One can ask this same question of the Arabs. Sadly,
O'Leary's book does not answer this question, and we must look elsewhere
for the answer." I did not answer this question I posed in the review because
it was not the place to answer it, but the answer is very clear, the Christian
Assyrian community was drained of its population through forced conversion
to Islam (by the <i>Jizzya</i>), and once the community had dwindled below
a critical threshold, it ceased producing the scholars that were the intellectual
driving force of the Islamic civilization, and that is when the so called
"Golden Age of Islam" came to an end (about 850 A.D.).
</p><p>Islam the religion itself was significantly molded by Assyrians and
Jews (see <font color="#990000">Nestorian Influence on Islam</font> and
<font color="#990000">Hagarism:
the Making of the Islamic World</font>).
</p><p>Arab/Islamic civilization is not a progressive force, it is a regressive
force; it does not give impetus, it retards. The great civilization you
describe was not an Arab/Muslim accomplishment, it was an Assyrian accomplishment
that Arabs expropriated and subsequently lost when they drained, through
the forced conversion of Assyrians to Islam, the source of the intellectual
vitality that propelled it. What other Arab/Muslim civilization has risen
since? What other Arab/Muslim successes can we cite?
</p><p>You state, "and perhaps we can learn a lesson from his [Suleiman] example:
It was leadership based on meritocracy, not inheritance. It was leadership
that harnessed the full capabilities of a very diverse population that
included Christianity, Islamic, and Jewish traditions." In fact, the Ottomans
were extremely oppressive to non-Muslims. For example, young Christian
boys were forcefully taken from their families, usually at the age of 8-10,
and inducted into the Janissaries, (<i>yeniceri</i> in Turkish) where they
were Islamized and made to fight for the Ottoman state. What literary,
artistic or scientific achievements of the Ottomans can we point to? We
can, on the other hand, point to the genocide of 750,000 Assyrians, 1.5
million Armenians and 400,000 Greeks in World War One by the Kemalist "Young
Turk" government. This is the true face of Islam.
</p><p>Arabs/Muslims are engaged in an explicit campaign of destruction and
expropriation of cultures and communities, identities and ideas. Wherever
Arab/Muslim civilization encounters a non-Arab/Muslim one, it attempts
to destroy it (as the Buddhist statues in Afghanistan were destroyed, as
Persepolis was destroyed by the Ayotollah Khomeini). This is a pattern
that has been recurring since the advent of Islam, 1400 years ago, and
is amply substantiated by the historical record. If the "foreign" culture
cannot be destroyed, then it is expropriated, and revisionist historians
claim that it is and was Arab, as is the case of most of the Arab "accomplishments"
you cited in your speech. For example, Arab history texts in the Middle
East teach that Assyrians were Arabs, a fact that no reputable scholar
would assert, and that no living Assyrian would accept. Assyrians first
settled Nineveh, one of the major Assyrian cities, in 5000 B.C., which
is 5630 years <i>before</i> Arabs came into that area. Even the word 'Arab'
is an Assyrian word, meaning "Westerner" (the first written reference to
Arabs was by the Assyrian King Sennacherib, 800 B.C., in which he tells
of conquering the "<i>ma'rabayeh</i>" -- Westerners. See <font color="#990000">The
Might That Was Assyria</font>, by H. W. F. Saggs).
</p><p>Even in America this <a href="http://aina.org/releases/2001/arabization.htm">Arabization
policy</a> continues. On October 27th a coalition of seven Assyrian and
Maronite organizations sent an official <a href="http://www.aina.org/releases/2001/caamletter.htm">letter</a>
to the Arab American Institute asking it to stop identifying Assyrians
and Maronites as Arabs, which it had been deliberately doing.
</p><p>There are minorities and nations struggling for survival in the Arab/Muslim
ocean of the Middle East and Africa (Assyrians, Armenians, Coptics, Jews,
southern Sudanese, Ethiopians, Nigerians...), and we must be very sensitive
not to unwittingly and inadvertently support Islamic fascism and Arab Imperialism,
with their attempts to wipe out all other cultures, religions and civilizations.
It is incumbent upon each one of us to do our homework and research when
making statements and speeches about these sensitive matters.
</p><p>I hope you found this information enlightening. For more information,
refer to the web links below. You may contact me at zibla@boogiedrop.com
for further questions.
</p><p>Thank you for your consideration.
