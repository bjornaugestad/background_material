</p><h2>Essay</h2><br>                                          <p align="left"><font size="2">[Note: This essay was originally printed in POLEMIC under the title
<br>"Second Thoughts on James Burnham", and later reprinted as a pamphlet
<br>with the present title.]
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>James Burnham's book, THE MANAGERIAL REVOLUTION, made a considerable stir
<br>both in the United States and in this country at the time when it was
<br>published, and its main thesis has been so much discussed that a detailed
<br>exposition of it is hardly necessary. As shortly as I can summarise it,
<br>the thesis is this:
<br>
<br>Capitalism is disappearing, but Socialism is not replacing it. What is
<br>now arising is a new kind of planned, centralised society which will be
<br>neither capitalist nor, in any accepted sense of the word, democratic.
<br>The rulers of this new society will be the people who effectively control
<br>the means of production: that is, business executives, technicians,
<br>bureaucrats and soldiers, lumped together by Burnham, under the name of
<br>"managers". These people will eliminate the old capitalist class, crush
<br>the working class, and so organise society that all power and economic
<br>privilege remain in their own hands. Private property rights will be
<br>abolished, but common ownership will not be established. The new
<br>"managerial" societies will not consist of a patchwork of small,
<br>independent states, but of great super-states grouped round the main
<br>industrial centres in Europe, Asia, and America. These super-states will
<br>fight among themselves for possession of the remaining uncaptured
<br>portions of the earth, but will probably be unable to conquer one another
<br>completely. Internally, each society will be hierarchical, with an
<br>aristocracy of talent at the top and a mass of semi-slaves at the bottom.
<br>
<br>In his next published book, THE MACHIAVELLIANS, Burnham elaborates and
<br>also modifies his original statement. The greater part of the book is an
<br>exposition of the theories of Machiavelli and of his modern disciples,
<br>Mosca, Michels, and Pareto: with doubtful justification, Burnham adds to
<br>these the syndicalist writer, Georges Sorel. What Burnham is mainly
<br>concerned to show is that a democratic society has never existed and, so
<br>far as we can see, never will exist. Society is of its nature
<br>oligarchical, and the power of the oligarchy always rests upon force and
<br>fraud. Burnham does not deny that "good" motives may operate in private
<br>life, but he maintains that politics consists of the struggle for power,
<br>and nothing else. All historical changes finally boil down to the
<br>replacement of one ruling class by another. All talk about democracy,
<br>liberty, equality, fraternity, all revolutionary movements, all visions
<br>of Utopia, or "the classless society", or "the Kingdom of Heaven on
<br>earth", are humbug (not necessarily conscious humbug) covering the
<br>ambitions of some new class which is elbowing its way into power. The
<br>English Puritans, the Jacobins, the Bolsheviks, were in each case simply
<br>power seekers using the hopes of the masses in order to win a privileged
<br>position for themselves. Power can sometimes be won or maintained without
<br>violence, but never without fraud, because it is necessary to make use of
<br>the masses, and the masses would not co-operate if they knew that they
<br>were simply serving the purposes of a minority. In each great
<br>revolutionary struggle the masses are led on by vague dreams of human
<br>brotherhood, and then, when the new ruling class is well established in
<br>power, they are thrust back into servitude. This is practically the whole
<br>of political history, as Burnham sees it.
<br>
<br>Where the second book departs from the earlier one is in asserting that
<br>the whole process could be somewhat moralised if the facts were faced
<br>more honestly. THE MACHIAVELLIANS is sub-titled DEFENDERS OF FREEDOM.
<br>Machiavelli and his followers taught that in politics decency simply does
<br>not exist, and, by doing so, Burnham claims, made it possible to conduct
<br>political affairs more intelligently and less oppressively. A ruling class
<br>which recognised that its real aim was to stay in power would also
<br>recognise that it would be more likely to succeed if it served the
<br>common good, and might avoid stiffening into a hereditary aristocracy.
<br>Burnham lays much stress on Pareto's theory of the "circulation
<br>of the élites". If it is to stay in power a ruling class must
<br>constantly admit suitable recruits from below, so that the ablest
<br>men may always be at the top and a new class of power-hungry
<br>malcontents cannot come into being. This is likeliest to happen, Burnham
<br>considers, in a society which retains democratic habits--that is, where
<br>opposition is permitted and certain bodies such as the press and the
<br>trade unions can keep their autonomy. Here Burnham undoubtedly
<br>contradicts his earlier opinion. In THE MANAGERIAL REVOLUTION, which was
<br>written in 1940, it is taken as a matter of course that "managerial"
<br>Germany is in all ways more efficient than a capitalist democracy such as
<br>France or Britain. In the second book, written in 1942, Burnham admits
<br>that the Germans might have avoided some of their more serious strategic
<br>errors if they had permitted freedom of speech. However, the main thesis
<br>is not abandoned. Capitalism is doomed, and Socialism is a dream. If we
<br>grasp what is at issue we may guide the course of the managerial
<br>revolution to some extent, but that revolution IS HAPPENING, whether we
<br>like it or not. In both books, but especially the earlier one, there is a
<br>note of unmistakable relish over the cruelty and wickedness of the
<br>processes that are being discussed. Although he reiterates that he is
<br>merely setting forth the facts and not stating his own preferences, it is
<br>clear that Burnham is fascinated by the spectacle of power, and that his
<br>sympathies were with Germany so long as Germany appeared to be winning
<br>the war. A more recent essay, "Lenin's Heir", published in the PARTISAN
<br>REVIEW about the beginning of 1945, suggests that this sympathy has since
<br>been transferred to the USSR. "Lenin's Heir", which provoked violent
<br>controversy in the American left-wing press, has not yet been reprinted
<br>in England, and I must return to it later.
<br>
<br>It will be seen that Burnham's theory is not, strictly speaking, a new
<br>one. Many earlier writers have foreseen the emergence of a new kind of
<br>society, neither capitalist nor Socialist, and probably based upon
<br>slavery: though most of them have differed from Burnham in not assuming
<br>this development to be INEVITABLE. A good example is Hilaire Belloc's
<br>book, THE SERVILE STATE, published in 1911. THE SERVILE STATE is written
<br>in a tiresome style, and the remedy it suggests (a return to small-scale
<br>peasant ownership) is for many reasons impossible: still, it does
<br>foretell with remarkable insight the kind of things that have been
<br>happening from about 1930 onwards. Chesterton, in a less methodical way,
<br>predicted the disappearance of democracy and private property, and the
<br>rise of a slave society which might be called either capitalist or
<br>Communist. Jack London, in THE IRON HEEL (1909), foretold some of the
<br>essential features of Fascism, and such books as Wells's THE SLEEPER
<br>AWAKES (1900), ZAMYATIN'S WE (1923), and Aldous Huxley's BRAVE NEW WORLD
<br>(1930), all described imaginary worlds in which the special problems of
<br>capitalism had been solved without bringing liberty, equality, or true
<br>happiness any nearer. More recently, writers like Peter Drucker and F.A.
<br>Voigt have argued that Fascism and Communism are substantially the same
<br>thing. And indeed, it has always been obvious that a planned and
<br>centralised society is liable to develop into an oligarchy or a
<br>dictatorship. Orthodox Conservatives were unable to see this, because it
<br>comforted them to assume that Socialism "wouldn't work", and that the
<br>disappearance of capitalism would mean chaos and anarchy. Orthodox
<br>Socialists could not see it, because they wished to think that they
<br>themselves would soon be in power, and therefore assumed that when
<br>capitalism disappears, Socialism takes its place. As a result they were
<br>unable to foresee the rise of Fascism, or to make correct predictions
<br>about it after it had appeared. Later, the need to justify the Russian
<br>dictatorship and to explain away the obvious resemblances between
<br>Communism and Nazism clouded the issue still more. But the notion that
<br>industrialism must end in monopoly, and that monopoly must imply tyranny,
<br>is not a startling one.
<br>
<br>Where Burnham differs from most other thinkers is in trying to plot the
<br>course of the "managerial revolution" accurately on a world scale, and in
<br>assuming that the drift towards totalitarianism is irresistible and must
<br>not be fought against, though it may be guided. According to Burnham,
<br>writing in 1940, "managerialism" has reached its fullest development in
<br>the USSR, but is almost equally well developed in Germany, and has made
<br>its appearance in the United States. He describes the New Deal as
<br>"primitive managerialism". But the trend is the same everywhere, or
<br>almost everywhere. Always LAISSEZ-FAIRE capitalism gives way to planning
<br>and state interference, the mere owner loses power as against the
<br>technician and the bureaucrat, but Socialism--that is to say, what used to
<br>be called Socialism--shows no sign of emerging:
<br>
<br>
<br>Some apologists try to excuse Marxism by saying that it has "never had a
<br>chance". This is far from the truth. Marxism and the Marxist parties have
<br>had dozens of chances. In Russia, a Marxist party took power. Within a
<br>short time it abandoned Socialism; if not in words, at any rate in the
<br>effect of its actions. In most European nations there were during the
<br>last months of the first world war and the years immediately thereafter,
<br>social crises which left a wide-open door for the Marxist parties:
<br>without exception they proved unable to take and hold power. In a large
<br>number of countries--Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Austria, England,
<br>Australia, New Zealand, Spain, France--the reformist Marxist parties have
<br>administered the governments, and have uniformly failed to introduce
<br>Socialism or make any genuine step towards Socialism. . .. These parties
<br>have, in practice, at every historical test--and there have been
<br>many--either failed Socialism or abandoned it. This is the fact which
<br>neither the bitterest foe nor the most ardent friend of Socialism can
<br>erase. This fact does not, as some think, prove anything about the moral
<br>quality of the Socialist ideal. But it does constitute unblinkable
<br>evidence that, whatever its moral quality, Socialism is not going to come.
<br>
<br>
<br>Burnham does not, of course, deny that the new "managerial" régimes,
<br>like the régimes of Russia and Nazi Germany, may be CALLED Socialist. He
<br>means merely that they will not be Socialist in any sense of the word
<br>which would have been accepted by Marx, or Lenin, or Keir Hardie, or
<br>William Morris, or indeed, by any representative Socialist prior to about
<br>1930. Socialism, until recently, was supposed to connote political
<br>democracy, social equality and internationalism. There is not the
<br>smallest sign that any of these things is in a way to being established
<br>anywhere, and the one great country in which something described as a
<br>proletarian revolution once happened, i.e. the USSR, has moved steadily
<br>away from the old concept of a free and equal society aiming at universal
<br>human brotherhood. In an almost unbroken progress since the early days of
<br>the Revolution, liberty has been chipped away and representative
<br>institutions smothered, while inequalities have increased and nationalism
<br>and militarism have grown stronger. But at the same time, Burnham
<br>insists, there has been no tendency to return to capitalism. What is
<br>happening is simply the growth of "managerialism", which, according to
<br>Burnham, is in progress everywhere, though the manner in which it comes
<br>about may vary from country to country.
<br>
<br>Now, as an interpretation of what is HAPPENING, Burnham's theory is
<br>extremely plausible, to put it at the lowest. The events of, at any rate,
<br>the last fifteen years in the USSR can be far more easily explained by
<br>this theory than by any other. Evidently the USSR is not Socialist, and
<br>can only be called Socialist if one gives the word a meaning different
<br>from what it would have in any other context. On the other hand,
<br>prophecies that the Russian reégime would revert to capitalism have
<br>always been falsified, and now seem further than ever from being
<br>fulfilled. In claiming that the process had gone almost equally far in
<br>Nazi Germany, Burnham probably exaggerates, but it seems certain that the
<br>drift was away from old-style capitalism and towards a planned economy
<br>with an adoptive oligarchy in control. In Russia the capitalists were
<br>destroyed first and the workers were crushed later. In Germany the
<br>workers were crushed first, but the elimination of the capitalists had at
<br>any rate begun, and calculations based on the assumption that Nazism was
<br>"simply capitalism" were always contradicted by events. Where Burnham
<br>seems to go most astray is in believing "managerialism" to be on the
<br>up-grade in the United States, the one great country where free
<br>capitalism is still vigorous. But if one considers the world movement as
<br>a whole, his conclusions are difficult to resist; and even in the United
<br>States the all-prevailing faith in LAISSEZ-FAIRE may not survive the next
<br>great economic crisis. It has been urged against Burnham that he assigns
<br>far too much importance to the "managers", in the narrow sense of the
<br>word-that is, factory bosses, planners and technicians--and seems to
<br>assume that even in Soviet Russia it is these people, and not the
<br>Communist Party chiefs, who are the real holders of power. However, this
<br>is a secondary error, and it is partially corrected in THE
<br>MACHIAVELLIANS. The real question is not whether the people who wipe
<br>their boots on us during the next fifty years are to be called managers,
<br>bureaucrats, or politicians: the question is whether capitalism, now
<br>obviously doomed, is to give way to oligarchy or to true democracy.
<br>
<br>But curiously enough, when one examines the predictions which Burnham has
<br>based on his general theory, one finds that in so far as they are
<br>verifiable, they have been falsified. Numbers of people have pointed this
<br>out already. However, it is worth following up Burnham's predictions in
<br>detail, because they form a sort of pattern which is related to
<br>contemporary events, and which reveals, I believe, a very important
<br>weakness in present-day political thought.
<br>
<br>To begin with, writing in 1940, Burnham takes a German victory more or
<br>less for granted. Britain is described as "dissolving", and as displaying
<br>"all the characteristics which have distinguished decadent cultures in
<br>past historical transitions", while the conquest and integration of
<br>Europe which Germany achieved in 1940 is described as "irreversible".
<br>"England," writes Burnham, "no matter with what non-European allies,
<br>cannot conceivably hope to conquer the European continent." Even if
<br>Germany should somehow manage to lose the war, she could not be
<br>dismembered or reduced to the status of the Weimar Republic, but is bound
<br>to remain as the nucleus of a unified Europe. The future map of the
<br>world, with its three great super-states is, in any case, already settled
<br>in its main outlines: and "the nuclei of these three super-states are,
<br>whatever may be their future names, the previously existing nations,
<br>Japan, Germany, and the United States."
<br>
<br>Burnham also commits himself to the opinion that Germany will not attack
<br>the USSR until after Britain has been defeated. In a condensation of his
<br>book published in the PARTISAN REVIEW of May-June 1941, and presumably
<br>written later than the book itself, he says:
<br>
<br>
<br>As in the case of Russia, so with Germany, the third part of the
<br>managerial problem--the contest for dominance with other sections of
<br>managerial society--remains for the future. First had to come the
<br>death-blow that assured the toppling of the capitalist world order, which
<br>meant above all the destruction of the foundations of the British Empire
<br>(the keystone of the capitalist world order) both directly and through
<br>the smashing of the European political structure, which was a necessary
<br>prop of the Empire. This is the basic explanation of the Nazi-Soviet
<br>Pact, which is not intelligible on other grounds. The future conflict
<br>between Germany and Russia will be a managerial conflict proper; prior to
<br>the great world-managerial battles, the end of the capitalist order must
<br>be assured. The belief that Nazism is "decadent capitalism" . . . makes
<br>it impossible to explain reasonably the Nazi-Soviet Pact. From this
<br>belief followed the always expected war between Germany and Russia, not
<br>the actual war to the death between Germany and the British Empire. The
<br>war between Germany and Russia is one of the managerial wars of the
<br>future, not of the anti-capitalist wars of yesterday and today.
<br>
<br>
<br>However, the attack on Russia will come later, and Russia is certain, or
<br>almost certain, to be defeated. "There is every reason to believe. . .
<br>that Russia will split apart, with the western half gravitating towards
<br>the European base and the eastern towards the Asiatic." This quotation
<br>comes from THE MANAGERIAL REVOLUTION. In the above quoted article, written
<br>probably about six months later, it is put more forcibly: "the Russian
<br>weaknesses indicate that Russia will not be able to endure, that it will
<br>crack apart, and fall towards east and west." And in a supplementary note
<br>which was added to the English (Pelican) edition, and which appears to
<br>have been written at the end of 1941, Burnham speaks as though the
<br>"cracking apart" process were already happening. The war, he says, "is
<br>part of the means whereby the western half of Russia is being integrated
<br>into the European super-state".
<br>
<br>Sorting these various statements out, we have the following prophecies:
<br>
<br>1. Germany is bound to win the war.
<br>2. Germany and Japan are bound to survive as great states, and to remain
<br>the nuclei of power in their respective areas.
<br>3. Germany will not attack the USSR until after the defeat of Britain.
<br>4. The USSR is bound to be defeated.
<br>
<br>However, Burnham has made other predictions besides these. In a short
<br>article in the PARTISAN REVIEW, in the summer of 1944, he gives his
<br>opinion that the USSR will gang up with Japan in order to prevent the
<br>total defeat of the latter, while the American Communists will be set to
<br>work to sabotage the eastern end of the war. And finally, in an article
<br>in the same magazine in the winter of 1944-5, he claims that Russia,
<br>destined so short a while ago to "crack apart", is within sight of
<br>conquering the whole of Eurasia. This article, which was the cause of
<br>violent controversies among the American intelligentsia, has not been
<br>reprinted in England. I must give some account of it here, because its
<br>manner of approach and its emotional tone are of a peculiar kind, and by
<br>studying them one can get nearer to the real roots of Burnham's theory.
<br>
<br>The article is entitled "Lenin's Heir", and it sets out to show that
<br>Stalin is the true and legitimate guardian of the Russian Revolution,
<br>which he has not in any sense "betrayed" but has merely carried forward
<br>on lines that were implicit in it from the start. In itself, this is an
<br>easier opinion to swallow than the usual Trotskyist claim that Stalin is
<br>a mere crook who has perverted the Revolution to his own ends, and that
<br>things would somehow have been different if Lenin had lived or Trotsky
<br>had remained in power. Actually there is no strong reason for thinking
<br>that the main lines of development would have been very different. Well
<br>before 1923 the seeds of a totalitarian society were quite plainly there.
<br>Lenin, indeed, is one of those politicians who win an undeserved
<br>reputation by dying prematurely. [See Note at end of paragraph] Had he
<br>lived, it is probable that he would either have been thrown out, like
<br>Trotsky, or would have kept himself in power by methods as barbarous,
<br>or nearly as barbarous, as those of Stalin. The TITLE of Burnham's essay,
<br>therefore, sets forth a reasonable thesis, and one would expect him to
<br>support it by an appeal to the facts.
<br>
<br>[Note: It is difficult to think of any politician who has lived to be
<br>eighty and still been regarded as a success. What we call a "great"
<br>statesman normally means one who dies before his policy has had time to
<br>take effect. If Cromwell had lived a few years longer he would probably
<br>have fallen from power, in which case we should now regard him as a
<br>failure. If Pétain had died in 1930, France would have venerated him as a
<br>hero and patriot. Napoleon remarked once that if only a cannon-ball had
<br>happened to hit him when he was riding into Moscow, he would have gone
<br>down to history as the greatest man who ever lived. [Author's footnote.]]
<br>
<br>However, the essay barely touches upon its ostensible subject matter. It
<br>is obvious that anyone genuinely concerned to show that there has been
<br>continuity of policy as between Lenin and Stalin would start by outlining
<br>Lenin's policy and then explain in what way Stalin's has resembled it.
<br>Burnham does not do this. Except for one or two cursory sentences he says
<br>nothing about Lenin's policy, and Lenin's name only occurs five times in
<br>an essay of twelve pages: in the first seven pages, apart from the title,
<br>it does not occur at all. The real aim of the essay is to present Stalin
<br>as a towering, super-human figure, indeed a species of demigod, and
<br>Bolshevism as an irresistible force which is flowing over the earth and
<br>cannot be halted until it reaches the outermost borders of Eurasia. In so
<br>far as he makes any attempt to prove his case, Burnham does so by
<br>repeating over and over again that Stalin is "a great man"--which is
<br>probably true, but is almost completely irrelevant. Moreover, though he
<br>does advance some solid arguments for believing in Stalin's genius, it is
<br>clear that in his mind the idea of "greatness" is inextricably mixed up
<br>with the idea of cruelty and dishonesty. There are curious passages in
<br>which it seems to be suggested that Stalin is to be admired BECAUSE OF
<br>the limitless suffering that he has caused:
<br>
<br>
<br>Stalin proves himself a "great man", in the grand style. The accounts of
<br>the banquets, staged in Moscow for the visiting dignitaries, set the
<br>symbolic tone. With their enormous menus of sturgeon, and roasts, and
<br>fowl, and sweets; their streams of liquor; the scores of toasts with
<br>which they end; the silent, unmoving secret police behind each guest; all
<br>against the winter background of the starving multitudes of besieged
<br>Leningrad; the dying millions at the front; the jammed concentration
<br>camps; the city crowds kept by their minute rations just at the edge of
<br>life; there is little trace of dull mediocrity or the hand of Babbitt. We
<br>recognise, rather, the tradition of the most spectacular of the Tsars, of
<br>the Great Kings of the Medes and Persians, of the Khanate of the Golden
<br>Horde, of the banquet we assign to the gods of the Heroic Ages in tribute
<br>to the insight that insolence, and indifference, and brutality on such a
<br>scale remove beings from the human level. . . . Stalin's political
<br>techniques shows a freedom from conventional restrictions that is
<br>incompatible with mediocrity: the mediocre man is custombound. Often it
<br>is the scale of their operations that sets them apart. It is usual, for
<br>example, for men active in practical life to engineer an occasional
<br>frame-up. But to carry out a frame-up against tens of thousands of
<br>persons, important percentages of whole strata of society, including most
<br>of one's own comrades, is so far out of the ordinary that the long-run
<br>mass conclusion is either that the frame-up must be true--at least "have
<br>some truth in it"--or that power so immense must be submitted to is a
<br>"historical necessity", as intellectuals put it. . . . There is nothing
<br>unexpected in letting a few individuals starve for reasons of state; but
<br>to starve by deliberate decision, several millions, is a type of action
<br>attributed ordinarily only to gods.
<br>
<br>
<br>In these and other similar passages there may be a tinge of irony, but it
<br>is difficult not to feel that there is also a sort of fascinated
<br>admiration. Towards the end of the essay Burnham compares Stalin with
<br>those semi-mythical heroes, like Moses or Asoka, who embody in themselves
<br>a whole epoch, and can justly be credited with feats that they did not
<br>actually perform. In writing of Soviet foreign policy and its supposed
<br>objectives, he touches an even more mystical note:
<br>
<br>
<br>Starting from the magnetic core of the Eurasian heartland, the Soviet
<br>power, like the reality of the One of Neo-Platonism overflowing in the
<br>descending series of the emanative progression, flows outward, west into
<br>Europe, south into the Near East, east into China, already lapping the
<br>shores of the Atlantic, the Yellow and China Seas, the Mediterranean, and
<br>the Persian Gulf. As the undifferentiated One, in its progression,
<br>descends through the stages of Mind, Soul, and Matter, and then through
<br>its fatal Return back to itself; so does the Soviet power, emanating from
<br>the integrally totalitarian centre, proceed outwards by Absorption (the
<br>Baltics, Bessarabia, Bukovina, East Poland), Domination (Finland, the
<br>Balkans, Mongolia, North China and, tomorrow, Germany), Orienting
<br>Influence (Italy, France, Turkey, Iran, Central and south China. . .),
<br>until it is dissipated in MH ON, the outer material sphere, beyond the
<br>Eurasian boundaries, of momentary Appeasement and Infiltration (England,
<br>the United States).
<br>
<br>
<br>I do not think it is fanciful to suggest that the unnecessary capital
<br>letters with which this passage is loaded are intended to have a hypnotic
<br>effect on the reader. Burnham is trying to build up a picture of
<br>terrifying, irresistible power, and to turn a normal political manoeuvre
<br>like infiltration into Infiltration adds to the general portentousness.
<br>The essay should be read in full. Although it is not the kind of tribute
<br>that the average russophile would consider acceptable, and although
<br>Burnham himself would probably claim that he is being strictly objective,
<br>he is in effect performing an act of homage, and even of self-abasement.
<br>Meanwhile, this essay gives us another prophecy to add to the list: i.e.
<br>that the USSR will conquer the whole of Eurasia, and probably a great
<br>deal more. And one must remember that Burnham's basic theory contains, in
<br>itself, a prediction which still has to be tested--that is, that whatever
<br>else happens, the "managerial" form of society is bound to prevail.
<br>
<br>Burnham's earlier prophecy, of a Germany victory in the war and the
<br>integration of Europe round the German nucleus, was falsified, not only
<br>in its main outlines, but in some important details. Burnham insists all
<br>the way through that "managerialism" is not only more efficient than
<br>capitalist democracy or Marxian Socialism, but also more acceptable to
<br>the masses. The slogans of democracy and national self-determination, he
<br>says, no longer have any mass appeal: "managerialism", on the other hand,
<br>can rouse enthusiasm, produce intelligible war aims, establish fifth
<br>columns everywhere, and inspire its soldiers with a fanatical morale. The
<br>"fanaticism" of the Germans, as against the "apathy" or "indifference" of
<br>the British, French, etc, is much emphasised, and Nazism is represented
<br>as a revolutionary force sweeping across Europe and spreading its
<br>philosophy "by contagion". The Nazi fifth columns "cannot be wiped out",
<br>and the democratic nations are quite incapable of projecting any
<br>settlement which the German or other European masses would prefer to the
<br>New Order. In any case, the democracies can only defeat Germany if they
<br>go "still further along the managerial road than Germany has yet gone".
<br>
<br>The germ of truth in all this is that the smaller European states,
<br>demoralised by the chaos and stagnation of the pre-war years, collapsed
<br>rather more quickly than they need have done, and might conceivably have
<br>accepted the New Order if the Germans had kept some of their promises.
<br>But the actual experience of German rule aroused almost at once such a
<br>fury of hatred and vindictiveness as the world has seldom seen. After
<br>about the beginning of 1941 there was hardly any need of a positive war
<br>aim, since getting rid of the Germans was a sufficient objective. The
<br>question of morale, and its relation to national solidarity, is a
<br>nebulous one, and the evidence can be so manipulated as to prove almost
<br>anything. But if one goes by the proportion of prisoners to other
<br>casualties, and the amount of quislingism, the totalitarian states come
<br>out of the comparison worse than the democracies. Hundreds of thousands
<br>of Russians appear to have gone over to the Germans during the course of
<br>the war, while comparable numbers of Germans and Italians had gone over
<br>to the Allies before the war started: the corresponding number of
<br>American or British renegades would have amounted to a few scores. As an
<br>example of the inability of "capitalist ideologies" to enlist support,
<br>Burnham cites "the complete failure of voluntary military recruiting in
<br>England (as well as the entire British Empire) and in the United States".
<br>One would gather from this that the armies of the totalitarian states
<br>were manned by volunteers. Actually, no totalitarian state has ever so
<br>much as considered voluntary recruitment for any purpose, nor, throughout
<br>history, has a large army ever been raised by voluntary means. [Note at
<br>end of paragraph] It is not worth listing the many similar arguments that
<br>Burnham puts forward. The point is that he assumes that the Germans must
<br>win the propaganda war as well as the military one, and that, at any rate
<br>in Europe, this estimate was not borne out by events.
<br>
<br>[Note: Great Britain raised a million volunteers in the earlier part of
<br>the 1914-18 war. This must be a world's record, but the pressures applied
<br>were such that it is doubtful whether the recruitment ought to be
<br>described as voluntary. Even the most "ideological" wars have been fought
<br>largely by pressed men. In the English civil war, the Napoleonic wars,
<br>the American civil war, the Spanish civil war, etc, both sides resorted
<br>to conscription or the press gang. (Author's footnote.)]
<br>
<br>It will be seen that Burnham's predictions have not merely, when they
<br>were verifiable, turned out to be wrong, but that they have sometimes
<br>contradicted one another in a sensational way. It is this last fact that
<br>is significant. Political predictions are usually wrong, because they are
<br>usually based on wish-thinking, but they can have symptomatic value,
<br>especially when they change abruptly. Often the revealing factor is the
<br>date at which they are made. Dating Burnham's various writings as
<br>accurately as can be done from internal evidence, and then noting what
<br>events they coincided with, we find the following relationships:
<br>
<br>In THE MANAGERIAL REVOLUTION Burnham prophesies a German victory,
<br>postponement of the Russo-German war until after Britain is defeated,
<br>and, subsequently, the defeat of Russia. The book, or much of it, was
<br>written in the second half of 1940--i.e. at a time when the Germans had
<br>overrun western Europe and were bombing Britain, and the Russians were
<br>collaborating with them fairly closely, and in what appeared, at any
<br>rate, to be a spirit of appeasement.
<br>
<br>In the supplementary note added to the English edition of the book,
<br>Burnham appears to assume that the USSR is already beaten and the
<br>splitting-up process is about to begin. This was published in the spring
<br>of 1942 and presumably written at the end of 1941; i.e. when the Germans
<br>were in the suburbs of Moscow.
<br>
<br>The prediction that Russia would gang up with Japan against the USA was
<br>written early in 1944, soon after the conclusion of a new Russo-Japanese
<br>treaty.
<br>
<br>The prophecy of Russian world conquest was written in the winter of 1944,
<br>when the Russians were advancing rapidly in eastern Europe while the
<br>Western Allies were still held up in Italy and northern France.
<br>
<br>It will be seen that at each point Burnham is predicting A CONTINUATION
<br>OF THE THING THAT IS HAPPENING. Now the tendency to do this is not simply
<br>a bad habit, like inaccuracy or exaggeration, which one can correct by
<br>taking thought. It is a major mental disease, and its roots lie partly in
<br>cowardice and partly in the worship of power, which is not fully
<br>separable from cowardice.
<br>
<br>Suppose in 1940 you had taken a Gallup poll, in England, on the question
<br>"Will Germany win the war?" You would have found, curiously enough, that
<br>the group answering "Yes" contained a far higher percentage of
<br>intelligent people--people with IQ of over 120, shall we say--than the
<br>group answering "No". The same would have held good in the middle of
<br>1942. In this case the figures would not have been so striking, but if
<br>you had made the question "Will the Germans capture Alexandria?" or "Will
<br>the Japanese be able to hold on to the territories they have captured ?",
<br>then once again there would have been a very marked tendency for
<br>intelligence to concentrate in the "Yes" group. In every case the
<br>less-gifted person would have been likelier to give a right answer.
<br>
<br>If one went simply by these instances, one might assume that high
<br>intelligence and bad military judgement always go together. However, it
<br>is not so simple as that. The English intelligentsia, on the whole, were
<br>more defeatist than the mass of the people--and some of them went on being
<br>defeatist at a time when the war was quite plainly won--partly because
<br>they were better able to visualise the dreary years of warfare that lay
<br>ahead. Their morale was worse because their imaginations were stronger.
<br>The quickest way of ending a war is to lose it, and if one finds the
<br>prospect of a long war intolerable, it is natural to disbelieve in the
<br>possibility of victory. But there was more to it than that. There was
<br>also the disaffection of large numbers of intellectuals, which made it
<br>difficult for them not to side with any country hostile to Britain. And
<br>deepest of all, there was admiration--though only in a very few cases
<br>conscious admiration--for the power, energy, and cruelty of the Nazi
<br>régime. It would be a useful though tedious labour to go through the
<br>left-wing press and enumerate all the hostile references to Nazism during
<br>the years 1935-45. One would find, I have little doubt, that they reached
<br>their high-water mark in 1937-8 and 1944-5, and dropped off noticeably in
<br>the years 1939-42--that is, during the period when Germany seemed to be
<br>winning. One would find, also, the same people advocating a compromise
<br>peace in 1940 and approving the dismemberment of Germany in 1945. And if
<br>one studied the reactions of the English intelligentsia towards the USSR,
<br>there, too, one would find genuinely progressive impulses mixed up with
<br>admiration for power and cruelty. It would be grossly unfair to suggest
<br>that power worship is the only motive for russophile feeling, but it is
<br>one motive, and among intellectuals it is probably the strongest one.
<br>
<br>Power worship blurs political judgement because it leads, almost
<br>unavoidably, to the belief that present trends will continue. Whoever is
<br>winning at the moment will always seem to be invincible. If the Japanese
<br>have conquered south Asia, then they will keep south Asia for ever, if
<br>the Germans have captured Tobruk, they will infallibly capture Cairo; if
<br>the Russians are in Berlin, it will not be long before they are in
<br>London: and so on. This habit of mind leads also to the belief that
<br>things will happen more quickly, completely, and catastrophically than
<br>they ever do in practice. The rise and fall of empires, the disappearance
<br>of cultures and religions, are expected to happen with earthquake
<br>suddenness, and processes which have barely started are talked about as
<br>though they were already at an end. Burnham's writings are full of
<br>apocalyptic visions. Nations, governments, classes and social systems are
<br>constantly described as expanding, contracting, decaying, dissolving,
<br>toppling, crashing, crumbling, crystallising, and, in general, behaving
<br>in an unstable and melodramatic way. The slowness of historical change,
<br>the fact that any epoch always contains a great deal of the last epoch,
<br>is never sufficiently allowed for. Such a manner of thinking is bound to
<br>lead to mistaken prophecies, because, even when it gauges the direction
<br>of events rightly, it will miscalculate their tempo. Within the space of
<br>five years Burnham foretold the domination of Russia by Germany and of
<br>Germany by Russia. In each case he was obeying the same instinct: the
<br>instinct to bow down before the conqueror of the moment, to accept the
<br>existing trend as irreversible. With this in mind one can criticise his
<br>theory in a broader way.
<br>
<br>The mistakes I have pointed out do not disprove Burnham's theory, but
<br>they do cast light on his probable reasons for holding it. In this
<br>connection one cannot leave out of account the fact that Burnham is an
<br>American. Every political theory has a certain regional tinge about it,
<br>and every nation, every culture, has its own characteristic prejudices
<br>and patches of ignorance. There are certain problems that must almost
<br>inevitably be seen in a different perspective according to the
<br>geographical situation from which one is looking at them. Now, the
<br>attitude that Burnham adopts, of classifying Communism and Fascism as
<br>much the same thing, and at the same time accepting both of them--or, at
<br>any rate, not assuming that either must be violently struggled against--is
<br>essentially an American attitude, and would be almost impossible for an
<br>Englishman or any other western European. English writers who consider
<br>Communism and Fascism to be THE SAME THING invariably hold that both are
<br>monstrous evils which must be fought to the death: on the other hand, any
<br>Englishman who believes Communism and Fascism to be opposites will feel
<br>that he ought to side with one or the other. [Note 1 at end of paragraph]
<br>The reason for this difference of outlook is simple enough and, as usual,
<br>is bound up with wish-thinking. If totalitarianism triumphs and the dreams
<br>of the geopoliticians come true, Britain will disappear as a world power
<br>and the whole of western Europe will be swallowed by some single great
<br>state. This is not a prospect that it is easy for an Englishman to
<br>contemplate with detachment. Either he does not want Britain to
<br>disappear--in which case he will tend to construct theories proving the
<br>thing that he wants-or, like a minority of intellectuals, he will decide
<br>that his country is finished and transfer his allegiance to some foreign
<br>power. An American does not have to make the same choice. Whatever
<br>happens, the United States will survive as a great power, and from the
<br>American point of view it does not make much difference whether Europe is
<br>dominated by Russia or by Germany. Most Americans who think of the matter
<br>at all would prefer to see the world divided between two or three monster
<br>states which had reached their natural boundaries and could bargain with
<br>one another on economic issues without being troubled by ideological
<br>differences. Such a world-picture fits in with the American tendency to
<br>admire size for its own sake and to feel that success constitutes
<br>justification, and it fits in with the all-prevailing anti-British
<br>sentiment. In practice, Britain and the United States have twice been
<br>forced into alliance against Germany, and will probably, before long, be
<br>forced into alliance against Russia: but, subjectively, a majority of
<br>Americans would prefer either Russia or Germany to Britain, and, as
<br>between Russia and Germany, would prefer whichever seemed stronger at the
<br>moment. [Note 2 at end of paragraph] It is, therefore, not surprising that
<br>Burnham's world-view should often be noticeably close to that of the
<br>American imperialists on the one side, or to that of the isolationists on
<br>the other. It is a "tough" or "realistic" worldview which fits in with the
<br>American form of wish-thinking. The almost open admiration for Nazi
<br>methods which Burnham shows in the earlier of his two books, and which
<br>would seem shocking to almost any English reader, depends ultimately on
<br>the fact that the Atlantic is wider than the Channel.
<br>
<br>[Note 1: The only exception I am able to think of is Bernard Shaw, who,
<br>for some years at any rate, declared Communism and Fascism to be much the
<br>same thing, and was in favour of both of them. But Shaw, after all, is not
<br>an Englishman, and probably does not feel his fate to be bound up with
<br>that of Britain. (Author's footnote.)]
<br>
<br>[Note 2 As late as the autumn of 1945, a Gallup poll taken among the
<br>American troops in Germany showed that 51 percent "thought Hitler did much
<br>good before 1939". This was after five years of anti-Hitler propaganda.
<br>The verdict, as quoted, is not very strongly favourable to Germany, but
<br>it is hard to believe that a verdict equally favourable to Britain would
<br>be given by anywhere near 51 per cent of the American army. (Author's
<br>footnote.)]
<br>
<br>As I have said earlier, Burnham has probably been more right than wrong
<br>about the present and the immediate past. For quite fifty years past the
<br>general drift has almost certainly been towards oligarchy. The
<br>ever-increasing concentration of industrial and financial power; the
<br>diminishing importance of the individual capitalist or shareholder, and
<br>the growth of the new "managerial" class of scientists, technicians, and
<br>bureaucrats; the weakness of the proletariat against the centralised
<br>state; the increasing helplessness of small countries against big ones;
<br>the decay of representative institutions and the appearance of one-party
<br>régimes based on police terrorism, faked plebiscites, etc: all these
<br>things seem to point in the same direction. Burnham sees the trend and
<br>assumes that it is irresistible, rather as a rabbit fascinated by a boa
<br>constrictor might assume that a boa constrictor is the strongest thing in
<br>the world. When one looks a little deeper, one sees that all his ideas
<br>rest upon two axioms which are taken for granted in the earlier book and
<br>made partly explicit in the second one. They are:
<br>
<br>1. Politics is essentially the same in all ages.
<br>2. Political behaviour is different from other kinds of behaviour.
<br>
<br>To take the second point first. In THE MACHIAVELLIANS, Burnham insists
<br>that politics is simply the struggle for power. Every great social
<br>movement, every war, every revolution, every political programme, however
<br>edifying and Utopian, really has behind it the ambitions of some
<br>sectional group which is out to grab power for itself. Power can never be
<br>restrained by any ethical or religious code, but only by other power. The
<br>nearest possible approach to altruistic behaviour is the perception by a
<br>ruling group that it will probably stay in power longer if it behaves
<br>decently. But curiously enough, these generalisations only apply to
<br>political behaviour, not to any other kind of behaviour. In everyday life,
<br>as Burnham sees and admits, one cannot explain every human action by
<br>applying the principle of CUI BONO? Obviously, human beings have impulses
<br>which are not selfish. Man, therefore, is an animal that can act morally
<br>when he acts as an individual, but becomes immoral when he acts
<br>collectively. But even this generalisation only holds good for the higher
<br>groups. The masses, it seems, have vague aspirations towards liberty and
<br>human brotherhood, which are easily played upon by power-hungry
<br>individuals or minorities. So that history consists of a series of
<br>swindles, in which the masses are first lured into revolt by the promise
<br>of Utopia, and then, when they have done their job, enslaved over again
<br>by new masters.
<br>
<br>Political activity, therefore, is a special kind of behaviour,
<br>characterised by its complete unscrupulousness, and occurring only among
<br>small groups of the population, especially among dissatisfied groups
<br>whose talents do not get free play under the existing form of society.
<br>The great mass of the people--and this is where (2) ties up with (1)--will
<br>always be unpolitical. In effect, therefore, humanity is divided into two
<br>classes: the self-seeking, hypocritical minority, and the brainless mob
<br>whose destiny is always to be led or driven, as one gets a pig back to
<br>the sty by kicking it on the bottom or by rattling a stick inside a
<br>swill-bucket, according to the needs of the moment. And this beautiful
<br>pattern is to continue for ever. Individuals may pass from one category
<br>to another, whole classes may destroy other classes and rise to the
<br>dominant position, but the division of humanity into rulers and ruled is
<br>unalterable. In their capabilities, as in their desires and needs, men
<br>are not equal. There is an "iron law of oligarchy", which would operate
<br>even if democracy were not impossible for mechanical reasons.
<br>
<br>It is curious that in all his talk about the struggle for power, Burnham
<br>never stops to ask why people want power. He seems to assume that power
<br>hunger, although only dominant in comparatively few people, is a natural
<br>instinct that does not have to be explained, like the desire for food. He
<br>also assumes that the division of society into classes serves the same
<br>purpose in all ages. This is practically to ignore the history of
<br>hundreds of years. When Burnham's master, Machiavelli, was writing, class
<br>divisions were not only unavoidable, but desirable. So long as methods of
<br>production were primitive, the great mass of the people were necessarily
<br>tied down to dreary, exhausting manual labour: and a few people had to be
<br>set free from such labour, otherwise civilisation could not maintain
<br>itself, let alone make any progress. But since the arrival of the machine
<br>the whole pattern has altered. The justification for class distinctions,
<br>if there is a justification, is no longer the same, because there is no
<br>mechanical reason why the average human being should continue to be a
<br>drudge. True, drudgery persists; class distinctions are probably
<br>re-establishing themselves in a new form, and individual liberty is on
<br>the down-grade: but as these developments are now technically avoidable,
<br>they must have some psychological cause which Burnham makes no attempt to
<br>discover. The question that he ought to ask, and never does ask, is: Why
<br>does the lust for naked power become a major human motive exactly NOW,
<br>when the dominion of man over man is ceasing to be necessary? As for the
<br>claim that "human nature", or "inexorable laws" of this and that, make
<br>Socialism impossible, it is simply a projection of the past into the
<br>future. In effect, Burnham argues that because a society of free and
<br>equal human beings has never existed, it never can exist. By the same
<br>argument one could have demonstrated the impossibility of aeroplanes in
<br>1900, or of motor cars in 1850.
<br>
<br>The notion that the machine has altered human relationships, and that in
<br>consequence Machiavelli is out of date, is a very obvious one. If Burnham
<br>fails to deal with it, it can, I think, only be because his own power
<br>instinct leads him to brush aside any suggestion that the Machiavellian
<br>world of force, fraud, and tyranny may somehow come to an end. It is
<br>important to bear in mind what I said above: that Burnham's theory is
<br>only a variant--an American variant, and interesting because of its
<br>comprehensiveness--of the power worship now so prevalent among
<br>intellectuals. A more normal variant, at any rate in England, is
<br>Communism. If one examines the people who, having some idea of what the
<br>Russian régime is like, are strongly russophile, one finds that, on the
<br>whole, they belong to the "managerial" class of which Burnham writes.
<br>That is, they are not managers in the narrow sense, but scientists,
<br>technicians, teachers, journalists, broadcasters, bureaucrats,
<br>professional politicians: in general, middling people who feel themselves
<br>cramped by a system that is still partly aristocratic, and are hungry for
<br>more power and more prestige. These people look towards the USSR and see
<br>in it, or think they see, a system which eliminates the upper class,
<br>keeps the working class in its place, and hands unlimited power to people
<br>very similar to themselves. It was only AFTER the Soviet régime became
<br>unmistakably totalitarian that English intellectuals, in large numbers,
<br>began to show an interest in it. Burnham, although the English russophile
<br>intelligentsia would repudiate him, is really voicing their secret wish:
<br>the wish to destroy the old, equalitarian version of Socialism and usher
<br>in a hierarchical society where the intellectual can at last get his
<br>hands on the whip. Burnham at least has the honesty to say that Socialism
<br>isn't coming; the others merely say that Socialism is coming, and then
<br>give the word "Socialism" a new meaning which makes nonsense of the old
<br>one. But his theory, for all its appearance of objectivity, is the
<br>rationalisation of a wish. There is no strong reason for thinking that it
<br>tells us anything about the future, except perhaps the immediate future.
<br>It merely tells us what kind of world the "managerial" class themselves,
<br>or at least the more conscious and ambitious members of the class, would
<br>like to live in.
<br>
<br>Fortunately the "managers" are not so invincible as Burnham believes. It
<br>is curious how persistently, in THE MANAGERIAL REVOLUTION, he ignores the
<br>advantages, military as well as social, enjoyed by a democratic country.
<br>At every point the evidence is squeezed in order to show the strength,
<br>vitality, and durability of Hitler's crazy régime. Germany is expanding
<br>rapidly, and "rapid territorial expansion has always been a sign, not of
<br>decadence . . . but of renewal". Germany makes war successfully, and "the
<br>ability to make war well is never a sign of decadence but of its
<br>opposite". Germany also "inspires in millions of persons a fanatical
<br>loyalty. This, too, never accompanies decadence". Even the cruelty and
<br>dishonesty of the Nazi régime are cited in its favour, since "the young,
<br>new, rising social order is, as against the old, more likely to resort on
<br>a large scale to lies, terror, persecution". Yet, within only five years
<br>this young, new, rising social order had smashed itself to pieces and
<br>become, in Burnham's usage of the word, decadent. And this had happened
<br>quite largely because of the "managerial" (i.e. undemocratic) structure
<br>which Burnham admires. The immediate cause of the German defeat was the
<br>unheard-of folly of attacking the USSR while Britain was still undefeated
<br>and America was manifestly getting ready to fight. Mistakes of this
<br>magnitude can only be made, or at any rate they are most likely to be
<br>made, in countries where public opinion has no power. So long as the
<br>common man can get a hearing, such elementary rules as not fighting all
<br>your enemies simultaneously are less likely to be violated.
<br>
<br>But, in any case, one should have been able to see from the start that
<br>such a movement as Nazism could not produce any good or stable result.
<br>Actually, so long as they were winning, Burnham seems to have seen
<br>nothing wrong with the methods of the Nazis. Such methods, he says, only
<br>appear wicked because they are new:
<br>
<br>
<br>There is no historical law that polite manners and "Justice" shall
<br>conquer. In history there is always the question of WHOSE manners and
<br>WHOSE justice. A rising social class and a new order of society have got
<br>to break through the old moral codes just as they must break through the
<br>old economic and political institutions. Naturally, from the point of
<br>view of the old, they are monsters. If they win, they take care in due
<br>time of manners and morals.
<br>
<br>
<br>This implies that literally anything can become right or wrong if the
<br>dominant class of the moment so wills it. It ignores the fact that
<br>certain rules of conduct have to be observed if human society is to hold
<br>together at all. Burnham, therefore, was unable to see that the crimes
<br>and follies of the Nazi régime MUST lead by one route or another to
<br>disaster. So also with his new-found admiration for Stalinism. It is too
<br>early to say in just what way the Russian régime will destroy itself. If
<br>I had to make a prophecy, I should say that a continuation of the Russian
<br>policies of the last fifteen years--and internal and external policy, of
<br>course, are merely two facets of the same thing--can only lead to a war
<br>conducted with atomic bombs, which will make Hitler's invasion look like
<br>a tea-party. But at any rate, the Russian régime will either democratise
<br>itself, or it will perish. The huge, invincible, everlasting slave empire
<br>of which Burnham appears to dream will not be established, or, if
<br>established, will not endure, because slavery is no longer a stable basis
<br>for human society.
<br>
<br>One cannot always make positive prophecies, but there are times when one
<br>ought to be able to make negative ones. No one could have been expected
<br>to foresee the exact results of the Treaty of Versailles, but millions of
<br>thinking people could and did foresee that those results would be bad.
<br>Plenty of people, though not so many in this case, can foresee that the
<br>results of the settlement now being forced on Europe will also be bad.
<br>And to refrain from admiring Hitler or Stalin--that, too, should not
<br>require an enormous intellectual effort.
<br>
<br>But it is partly a moral effort. That a man of Burnham's gifts should
<br>have been able for a while to think of Nazism as something rather
<br>admirable, something that could and probably would build up a workable
<br>and durable social order, shows what damage is done to the sense of
<br>reality by the cultivation of what is now called "realism".
