nationalist Arab parties. But we think it would be an
even more practical and useful development if we

could convince ourselves that social-democratic parties,
if and when they establish contacts with other political
forces on other continents, need not simultaneously

enter into full - fledged fraternity - which, incidentally,
has not been demanded by our partners. We think there

is also need for a less emotional posture within the
Socialist International. What these forces want, and

we have seen this quite clearly, is to be liberated

from the apparently inescapable alternative of having

to make a choice either for â€œcapitalist America" or

for "communist Russia". Social Democracy and demo-

cratic Socialism really present themselves here as a third
force. During the last year, it was not the least due

to the fact-finding mission of the Socialist International
that leading politicians of the Arab countries have shown
a basic change in their attitude toward us. We think that
the established procedure of bilateral contacts of the
member parties of the Socialist International are useful,
but we should not overlook the fact that a rapprochement
between Arab parties and the Socialist International

could represent a ~ substantial precondition

for a new situation of dialogue between the Arab par-

ties and the Israeli Labour Party.
