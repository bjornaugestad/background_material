initially, the struggle of the Arabs for independence
and for the creation of a "United Arab State" was
frustrated because of two reasons:

1, the British government did not keep its promises
and agreements;

2. a heterogeneous state - Israel- wascreated which
separates the Arab Orient from Arab North Africa.

These two reasons or obstacles will be surmounted - as
the second tendency analyses ~ by neutralizing the

state of Israel." (Translation from German)

If a Palestinian state in the envisaged area, West Bank and
Gaza Strip, does come into existence, this newly created state
will pose overwhelming problems for its government. Such a
state will be unable to direct its attention towards anything
but internal tasks for a very lang time. Even if this state
could be armed with the aid of others, it will find itself,
in view of the military experience and the military por
tential of Israel and its army, in a hopeless position

and each attempt to look for war-like confrontations with
Israel would necessarily lead to a terrible counter-strike
which in its effect would qo far beyond anything that the
Arab side could oppose to it. At any rate, an organized

state consisting of the regions presently occupied by

Israel would constitute for the whole Arab world a far

more vulnerable area with regard to military retaliation
Measures than is the case with territories occupied by
Israel. If such as Palestinian state is created, one of the
logical consequences would be the successive dissolution

of the refugee camps. They were primarily meant to be

a parastate which would enable the Palestinian leader-

ship to fulfilâ€™ some quasi-qovernmental functions sich
