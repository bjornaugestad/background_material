and of the confidence-building measures which would

have to be an itegral part. We are not enough versed

in these questions in order to make concrete proposals
but already the agreements which have been signed

during the last two years have shown us that several
possibilities exist. We have not gained the impression
that the Geneva Conference - if it were possible to
proceed along these lines - represents the only way

for a solution but we believe that, at present, there

can not be any other practical peace-supporting measures
than a resumption of the Geneva Conference, its insti-
tutionalization over a longer period of time, in order

to make it possible to return to the conference table
again and again, â€˜also situations of crisis. . There
are examples in recent history that permanent conferences
of this kind have had no positive effect, but there are
also examples which prove that conferences of long duration
can bring about results, i.e. the negotiations about the
Austrian State Treaty. In all probability, there will be a
long series of detailed negotiations preceeding any peace-

ful solution,

Whatever our experiences with negotiations May have been,
democratic socialists simply can not depriv themselves

of the basic trust in negotiations between states.
