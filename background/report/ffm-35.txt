Arab states and leads to the distinct hope to ter-

as the primary threat to their security ~ if Israel
would set the preconditions for the termination of the
state of war by retreating from the territories occupied
in 1967 -, but by other states and developments. We

of the well-known geographic situation, is not necessary,

One problem, which apparently preoccupies the moderate
Arab statesmen to a very high degree, seems to be the
developments in Africa and in this context, above all,
