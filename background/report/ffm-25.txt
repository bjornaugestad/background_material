not to harbor any illusions with regard to these facts,
These positions have been expressed with equal deter-
mination by the King of Saudi Arabia and the Crown Prince
of Saudi Arabia as well as by the leading personalities
in the conservative gulf states. Similar views have
been expressed by King Hassan in his discussidhs with
us during the month of March, 1975. It may be true that
the unity shown by the Arab world in Rabat was only

on the surface, with regard to one question it ap-
pears to be very real: today the right of the Pale-
stinians to speak for themselves cannot be denied. No
Arab state could speak for them against their will. We
deliberately are very cautious in our formulations
since we do not want to hurt anyone, since we do not
want to deny our respect for the accomplishments which
may be observed in Jordan. It seems therefore all the
more important and necessary to us to point out that
the hope, which is still kept alive in some chancelleries,
a final solution can be found with the help of King
Hussein, is nothing but an illusion. We consider this
observation to be one of the most important results

of our fact-finding mission.
