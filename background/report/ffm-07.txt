It is not the task of this report to present de-
tailed suggestions for a solution; it is only
possible to indicate a framework and the general
direction where there is the potential for peace~
ful development. The question is too complex and
too much burdened with resentments. It will, there-
fore, require prolonged and tedious negotiations,
beyond the primary framwork indicated, which will
be similarly complicated as the ones about the

Austrian State Treaty.

According to the Arab view, normalization of re-
lations can only be expected after a number of
years. First of all, the peace settlement would
have to prove and strenghten itself and bring
about a gradual change in the state of mind of
both sides. The Israeli side occasionally expresses

the opinion that normalization has to come first
