"peace in our times", would be illusory. The maximum
result feasible would be a state of non-belligerency.

Other Arab leaders were more irreconciliable.

During the past four = years, there has been a total
change. Today most Arab governments support a peaceful
solution under certain circumstances. A few;"'like

the governments of Iraq and Libya, still continue

to hold to a negative posture. President Boumedienne's
position, which could almost be called a doctrine,
subscribes to the view that those Arab states which
are not immediate neighbors of Israel should not be
opposed to a solution which is acceptable to the Arab
neighbors of Israel. I may be assumed that this
Boumedienne Doctrine, as we would like to call it,

will eventually be accepted by all Arab states.

The question arising in this context is therefore the
following:

What is. the framework within which a peaceful
solution :~ ~ can be searched for and, eventually,
found? After many long discussions with almost all
leading personalities in the Arab world we have come
to the conclusion that the following points must be

taken into account:

1) Peace, in one form or another - and this .

could also mean some kind of peaceful co-existence -
