the end of belligerency. To make peace, that would be

the task of future generations, This is not the case

any more. Most Arab statesmen believe that presently
Israel - and we only report on their views -_ apparently
has no interest in making peace. They even believe that
the end of belligerency would have come had there been

a stonger institutionalization of the negotiations in
Geneva, since it is the mandate of the Geneva negotiations
to create peace. This changed posture appears to us to be
of some consequence, just like the demand for a return

to the borders of 1967, which already implies a recog-
nition of the existence of the state of Israel within
those borders. But there can be no doubt that no Arab
state, even the states not directly involved, can
withdraw the demand that allâ€™ the land conquered in the
war of 1967 will have to be returned. In our discussions,
there have been no indications whatsoever that there
exists a readiness to talk about revisions with regard

to territory - although minor ones need not necessarily

be totally precluded.

Every Arab statesman will support the position of Pre-
sident Sadat who said, during a press conference in
Vienna, that he could not relinquish one inch of soil.
But what we feel is feasible would be negotiations

about the time-table of such a return of territory
