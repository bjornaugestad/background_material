"Independent Arab and Jewish States and the Special
International Regime for the City of Jerusalem, set
forth in part III of this plan, shall come into
existence in Palestine two months after the evacuation
of the armed forces for the mandatory Power has been
completed but in any case not later than 1 Ocotber

1948." (for full text see annex II
ak
It remains the duty of member states of the United Nations

to work for the implementation of this resolution, even

if in a modified form.

From my discussions with leading personalities of the
Soviet-Union I know that they feel themsleves commited to
this resolution, in content as well as in principle.

The representative of the Soviet-Union at the UN at the
time (the present Minister of Foreign Affairs), Mr. Gromyko,
presented the position of his country in the 25th plenary
meeting of the General Assembly on November 26, 1947, as

follows:

"The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, as everyone
knows, has had no direct material or other interests
in Palestine; it is interested in the question of
Palestine because it is a Member of the United Nations
and because it is a great Power that bears, just as

do other great Powers, a special responsibility for
the maintenance of international peace. These facts
determine the stand taken by the Government of the

USSR on the question of Palestine.‚Äù
