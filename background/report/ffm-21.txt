successful in bringing about a peaceful solution,

_ peace would be a historical accomplishment of such

magnitude which has been denied to humanity for
centuries and I think that, for the first time,

the prospects do exist. If rapprochement were
possible - the idea of peace would have gained a
great, universally visible victory, and the Socialist

International would have contributed its share.

At this very moment it seems to me to be of. utmost
importance that we know our obligation and work in
this spirit. No other political movement in democratic

Europe can do it.

I therefore propose, as a practical step, that the
Socialist International organizes ‘without delay,
éspecially in view of the development in Israel to
the Right, a round-table conference with prominent
representatives of the Israeli labour movement and of
the other member parties. This conference should be
considered as the beginning of a series of meetings
to be planned over a short period. The objection which
will be raised, I can hear it already: such a thing
has to be well prepared. My reply, based on practical
experience of several decades, is simply this: If a
confrontation is prepared at length and takesplace

only then, one does not really need it any more. At

present, however, to meet is more important than

a forseeable result.
