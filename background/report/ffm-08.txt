and that this could then be the precondition for

a peaceful solution.

Recent history has presented us with concrete examples.
for both alternatives. I believe that, if both states
do exist side by side, the necessity for a â€˜process of
normalization with each other will arise very quickly:
the lack of natural resources would force Israel and
an eventual Palestinian state, probably also Jordan,
into it. Given a change of mind, even a very organic
cooperation with regard to economic questions could

develop very rapidly.

Concerning the question of Jerusalem, I would be the
last one who would want to minimize this problem. I am
nevertheless of the opinion that, as soon as a solution

will have been found for the main problem, it will be

possible to find one for Jerusalem too. The case of
Rome, which now is the capital of Italy as well as
the center of the Roman Catholic Church, could serve
as a historic example. In this context, it is worth
noting that, as far as I know, the position of the
King of Jordan as the Protector of the Holy Places
in Jerusalem has been untouched, even by the Rabat

Conference. =
