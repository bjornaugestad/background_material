REPORT

The Palestinians

The disputed question which we can not, and da,

not want to, answer in our report is the question

of the number of Palestinians living in the Arab
countries. The Israelis apparently do not focus their
attention on this question and they would like to
restrict themselves numerically to the Palestinians
living in the Israeli sphere of influence. There
exists the widely held view - which is, incidentally,

shared by large parts of the democratic world - that

â€˜it is the task of the Arab states to take care, through

assim iation, of the Palestinians living outside the
state and sphere of influence of Israel, including

the occupied territories. This appears to be, in our

view, a first serious error of judgment. The fact,

for instance, that an Arab of Palestinian extraction holds
an important job in the oil industry of Saudi Arabia,

or that another one is employd in the Kuwaiti ministry

of planning, should not lead to the conclusion that the

question of their national identity has now been solved
