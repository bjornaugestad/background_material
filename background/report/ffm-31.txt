The present crisis in Lebanon points at inner tensions
which it is not our present task to discuss and where
we do not have any relevant concrete facts at our dis-

that one of the organizations, which is considered to
be the most radical one, the organization of Dr. Habbash,
has publicly recognized the Israelis as a people with
its own nationality, which is evident from a document
circulated at the Congress of the Palestinians. This
organization supports the idea of the coexistence bet=
ween Palestinians and Israelis instead of one between
Moslems, Christians and Jews. In any case, we were in-
formed, by persons who are rather close to us politi-
cally, that this organization, because of its "socia-
list program" has no influence within the PLO, but hopes
to gain influence among the Palestinian people. But it
is a fact, without any doubt, that the overwhelming

majority of all Arab governments supports the PLO.

Presently there are 105 nations who recognize the PLO
as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian
people in one way or another. We may assume that it

is only a question of - very little - time until most
