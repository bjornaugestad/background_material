In this context we should not overlook a vital fact:

Final Remarks

We do not want to overestimate the importance of the
work of this fact-finding mission of the Socialist
International. But the fact that it was considered
necessary to accord the delegation a large degree

of attention with regard to politics, journalism and
protocol is proof that its importance was considered
to be quite great, That it was possible, in each and
everyone of the countries visited, to hold dis-
cussions which lasted on the average from 4 to 7 hours,
proves the thoroughness with which we dealt with the
pressing problems, That we were treated not only wit:
exceptional politeness but with great friendliness -
we are even tempted to say, genuine warm friendliness -
shows. how useful the mission has been, and that,
finally, there was acceptance of the fact that the So-
cialist International and the Socialist parties are

determined to give unswerving loyalty to the workersâ€™
