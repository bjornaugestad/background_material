of Israel and her manyfold social and national
problems. They proceed further in their internal
discussions and analysis and ascertain that with-
out war, the state of Israel will not have a very
long life-span for the following reasons:

1. Definitely established, secure frontiers
will eliminate an important foundation for the
creation of that state: the argument that Israel
can be a home for all Jews. For there ist not enough
space.

2. When the Jews have the possibility to live
in their state - Israel - securely and without
menace, then the motivation for the World-Jewry
to constantly support Israel financially will cease.
That will have the effect that the state of Israel
and her citizens shape their life in a normal way,
like all other states of the region. This means, at
the same time, that the messianic character of that
state ceases,

3, A peace settlement and the cessation of the
messianic character will lead to a resurg√©nce of the
national and social problems of that state, for
example the discrimination of Oriental Jews in
Israel, This situation will then be used by the Arabs
to persuade the Oriental Jews with generous financial
help to return to their Arab countries of origin. This
possibility is already practised. Through intercession
of the P.L.O. with some Arab countries it was
possible to persuade 500 Israeli families to return
to their Arab homelands with appropriate financial
help for the start.

4, If this process takes places as described,
= so this tendency believes - then the Israelis
finally will live as a strong minority in their
country. It is furthermore counted upon that the
Arab population in Israel will gradually become as
large as the Israeli. . ~
Once this situation is reached Israel will finally
no more be a obstacle to the Arab striving for unity,
neither nationally nor geographically. As stated
