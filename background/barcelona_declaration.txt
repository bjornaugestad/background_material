history;

•

aware that the new political, economic and social issues on both sides of the

•

regarding this multilateral framework as the counterpart to a strengthening of bilateral
relations which it is important to safeguard, while laying stress on their specific nature;

•

stressing that this EuroMediterranean initiative is not intended to replace the other
activities and initiatives undertaken in the interests of the peace, stability and

•

hereby agree to establish a comprehensive partnership among the participants the EuroMediterranean partnership through strengthened political dialogue on a regular basis, the
development of economic and financial cooperation and greater emphasis on the social,
cultural and human dimension, these being the three aspects of the EuroMediterranean
partnership.

Political & security partnership: Establishing a common area of peace & stability
The participants express their conviction that the peace, stability and security of the
Mediterranean region are a common asset which they pledge to promote and strengthen by
all means at their disposal. To this end they agree to conduct a strengthened political
dialogue at regular intervals, based on observance of essential principles of international law,
and reaffirm a number of common objectives in matters of internal and external stability.
In this spirit they undertake in the following declaration of principles to:
act in accordance with the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, as well as other obligations under international law, in particular those arising out of
regional and international instruments to which they are party;
develop the rule of law and democracy in their political systems, while recognizing in this
framework the right of each of them to choose and freely develop its own political, sociocultural, economic and judicial system;
respect human rights and fundamental freedoms and guarantee the effective legitimate
exercise of such rights and freedoms, including freedom of expression, freedom of
association for peaceful purposes and freedom of thought, conscience and religion, both
individually and together with other members of the same group, without any discrimination
on grounds of race, nationality, language, religion or sex;
give favourable consideration, through dialogue between the parties, to exchanges of
information on matters relating to human rights, fundamental freedoms, racism and
xenophobia;
respect and ensure respect for diversity and pluralism in their societies, promote tolerance
between different groups in society and combat manifestations of intolerance, racism and
xenophobia. The participants stress the importance of proper education in the matter of
human rights and fundamental freedoms;
respect their sovereign equality and all rights inherent in their sovereignty, and fulfil in good
faith the obligations they have assumed under international law;
respect the equal rights of peoples and their right to self-determination, acting at all times in
conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and with the
relevant norms of international law, including those relating to territorial integrity of States, as
reflected in agreements between relevant parties;
refrain, in accordance with the rules of international law, from any direct or indirect
intervention in the internal affairs of another partner;
respect the territorial integrity and unity of each of the other partners;
settle their disputes by peaceful means, call upon all participants to renounce recourse to the
threat or use of force against the territorial integrity of another participant, including the
acquisition of territory by force, and reaffirm the right to fully exercise sovereignty by
legitimate means in accordance with the UN Charter and international law;
strengthen their cooperation in preventing and combating terrorism, in particular by ratifying
and applying the international instruments they have signed, by acceding to such instruments
and by taking any other appropriate measure;
fight together against the expansion and diversification of organized crime and combat the
drugs problem in all its aspects;

- promote regional security by acting, inter alia, in favour of nuclear, chemical and biological
non-proliferation through adherence to and compliance with a combination of international
and regional non-proliferation regimes, and arms control and disarmament agreements such
as NPT, CWC, BWC, CTBT and/or regional arrangements such as weapons free zones
including their verification regimes, as well as by fulfilling in good faith their commitments
under arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation conventions.
The parties shall pursue a mutually and effectively verifiable Middle East Zone free of
weapons of mass destruction, nuclear, chemical and biological, and their delivery systems.
Furthermore the parties will consider practical steps to prevent the proliferation of nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons as well as excessive accumulation of conventional arms.
Refrain from developing military capacity beyond their legitimate defence requirements, at
the same time reaffirming their resolve to achieve the same degree of security and mutual
confidence with the lowest possible levels of troops and weaponry and adherence to CCW.
Promote conditions likely to develop good-neighbourly relations among themselves and
support processes aimed at stability, security, prosperity and regional and subregional
cooperation.
consider any confidence and security-building measures that could be taken between the
parties with a view to the creation of an "area of peace and stability in the Mediterranean",
including the long term possibility of establishing a Euro-Mediterranean pact to that end.

Economic & financial partnership: Creating an area of shared prosperity
The participants emphasize the importance they attach to sustainable and balanced
economic and social development with a view to achieving their objective of creating an area
of shared prosperity.
The partners acknowledge the difficulties that the question of debt can create for the
economic development of the countries of the Mediterranean region. They agree, in view of
the importance of their relations, to continue the dialogue in order to achieve progress in the
competent fora.
Noting that the partners have to take up common challenges, albeit to varying degrees, the
participants set themselves the following long-term objectives:
•

acceleration of the pace of sustainable socio-economic development;

•

improvement of the living conditions of their populations, increase in the employment
level and reduction in the development gap in the EuroMediterranean region;

•

encouragement of regional cooperation and integration.

With a view to achieving these objectives, the participants agree to establish an economic
and financial partnership which, taking into account the different degrees of development, will
be based on:
•

the progressive establishment of a free-trade area;

•

the implementation of appropriate economic cooperation and concerted action in the
relevant areas;

•

a substantial increase in the European Union's financial assistance to its partners.

a) Free-trade area
The free-trade area will be established through the new EuroMediterranean Agreements and
free-trade agreements between partners of the European Union. The parties have set 2010
as the target date for the gradual establishment of this area which will cover most trade with
due observance of the obligations resulting from the WTO.
With a view to developing gradual free trade in this area: tariff and nontariff barriers to trade
in manufactured products will be progressively eliminated in accordance with timetables to
be negotiated between the partners; taking as a starting point traditional trade flows, and as
far as the various agricultural policies allow and with due respect to the results achieved
within the GATT negotiations, trade in agricultural products will be progressively liberalized
through reciprocal preferential access among the parties; trade in services including right of
establishment will be progressively liberalized having due regard to the GATS agreement.
The participants decide to facilitate the progressive establishment of this free-trade area
through
•

the adoption of suitable measures as regard rules of origin, certification, protection of
intellectual and industrial property rights and competition;

•

the pursuit and the development of policies based on the principles of market economy
and the integration of their economies taking into account their respective needs and
levels of development;

•

the adjustment and modernization of economic and social structures, giving priority to the
promotion and development of the private sector, to the upgrading of the productive
sector and to the establishment of an appropriate institutional and regulatory framework
for a market economy. They will likewise endeavour to mitigate the negative social
consequences which may result from this adjustment, by promoting programmes for the
benefit of the neediest populations;

•

the promotion of mechanisms to foster transfers of technology.

b) Economic cooperation and concerted action
Cooperation will be developed in particular in the areas listed below and in this respect the
participants:
acknowledge that economic development must be supported both by internal savings, the
basis of investment, and by direct foreign investment. They stress the importance of creating
an environment conducive to investment, in particular by the progressive elimination of
obstacles to such investment which could lead to the transfer of technology and increase
production and exports;
affirm that regional cooperation on a voluntary basis, particularly with a view to developing
trade between the partners themselves, is a key factor in promoting the creation of a freetrade area;
- encourage enterprises to enter into agreements with each other and undertake to promote
such cooperation and industrial modernization by providing a favourable environment and
regulatory framework. They consider it necessary to adopt and to implement a technical
support programme for SMEs;
emphasize their interdependence with regard to the environment, which necessitates a
regional approach and increased cooperation, as well as better coordination of existing
multilateral programmes, while confirming their attachment to the Barcelona Convention and
the Mediterranean Action Plan. They recognize the importance of reconciling economic

development with environmental protection, of integrating environmental concerns into the
relevant aspects of economic policy and of mitigating the negative environmental
consequences which might result. They undertake to establish a short and medium-term
priority action programme, including in connection with combating desertification, and to
concentrate appropriate technical and financial support on those actions;
recognize the key role of women in development and undertake to promote their active
participation in economic and social life and in the creation of employment;
stress the importance of the conservation and rational management of fish stocks and of the
improvement of cooperation on research into stocks, including aquaculture, and undertake to
facilitate scientific training and research and to envisage creating joint instruments;
acknowledge the pivotal role of the energy sector in the economic EuroMediterranean
partnership and decide to strengthen cooperation and intensify dialogue in the field of energy
policies. They also decide to create the appropriate framework conditions for investments
and the activities of energy companies, cooperating in creating the conditions enabling such
companies to extend energy networks and promote link-ups;
- recognize that water supply together with suitable management and development of
resources are priority issues for all Mediterranean partners and that cooperation should be
developed in these areas;
agree to cooperate in modernizing and restructuring agriculture and in promoting integrated
rural development. This cooperation will focus in particular on technical assistance and
training, on support for policies implemented by the partners to diversify production, on the
reduction of food dependency and on the promotion of environment-friendly agriculture. They
also agree to cooperate in the eradication of illicit crops and the development of any regions
affected.
The participants also agree to cooperate in other areas and, to that effect:
stress the importance of developing and improving infrastructures, including through the
establishment of an efficient transport system, the development of information technologies
and the modernization of telecommunications. They agree to draw up a programme of
priorities for that purpose;
- undertake to respect the principles of international maritime law, in particular freedom to
provide services in international transport and free access to international cargoes. The
results of the ongoing multilateral trade negotiations on maritime transport services being
conducted within the WTO will be taken into account when agreed;
undertake to encourage cooperation between local authorities and in support of regional
planning;
recognizing that science and technology have a significant influence on socioeconomic
development, agree to strengthen scientific research capacity and development, contribute to
the training of scientific and technical staff and promote participation in joint research projects
based on the creation of scientific networks;
agree to promote cooperation on statistics in order to harmonize methods and exchange
data.

c) Financial cooperation
The participants consider that the creation of a free-trade area and the success of the EuroMediterranean partnership require a substantial increase in financial assistance, which must
above all encourage sustainable indigenous development and the mobilization of local
economic operators. They note in this connection that:
the Cannes European Council agreed to set aside ECU 4 685 million for this financial
assistance in the form of available Community budget funds for the period 1995-1999. This
will be supplemented by EIB assistance in the form of increased loans and the bilateral
financial contributions from the Member States;
effective financial cooperation managed in the framework of a multiannual programme,
taking into account the special characteristics of each of the partners is necessary;
sound macro-economic management is of fundamental importance in ensuring the success
of the partnership. To this end they agree to promote dialogue on their respective economic
policies and on the method of optimizing financial cooperation.

Partnership in social, cultural and Human affairs: Developing human ressources,
promoting understanding between cultures & exchanges between civil societies
The participants recognize that the traditions of culture and civilization throughout the
Mediterranean region, dialogue between these cultures and exchanges at human, scientific
and technological level are an essential factor in bringing their peoples closer, promoting
understanding between them and improving their perception of each other.
In this spirit, the participants agree to establish a partnership in social, cultural and human
affairs. To this end:
they reaffirm that dialogue and respect between cultures and religions are a necessary precondition for bringing the peoples closer. In this connection they stress the importance of the
role the mass media can play in the reciprocal recognition and understanding of cultures as a
source of mutual enrichment;
they stress the essential nature of the development of human resources, both as regards the
education and training of young people in particular and in the area of culture. They express
their intent to promote cultural exchanges and knowledge of other languages, respecting the
cultural identity of each partner, and to implement a lasting policy of educational and cultural
programmes; in this context, the partners undertake to adopt measures to facilitate human
exchanges, in particular by improving administrative procedures;
they underline the importance of the health sector for sustainable development and express
their intention of promoting the effective participation of the community in operations to
improve health and well-being;
they recognize the importance of social development which, in their view, must go hand in
hand with any economic development. They attach particular importance to respect for
fundamental social rights, including the right to development;
they recognize the essential contribution civil society can make in the process of
development of the EuroMediterranean partnership and as an essential factor for greater
understanding and closeness between peoples;
they accordingly agree to strengthen and/or introduce the necessary instruments of
decentralized cooperation to encourage exchanges between those active in development

within the framework of national laws: leaders of political and civil society, the cultural and
religious world, universities, the research community, the media, organizations, the trade
unions and public and private enterprises;
on this basis, they recognize the importance of encouraging contacts and exchanges
between young people in the context of programmes for decentralized cooperation;
they will encourage actions of support for democratic institutions and for the strengthening of
the rule of law and civil society;
they recognize that current population trends represent a priority challenge which must be
counterbalanced by appropriate policies to accelerate economic takeoff;
they acknowledge the importance of the role played by migration in their relationships. They
agree to strengthen their cooperation to reduce migratory pressures, among other things
through vocational training programmes and programmes of assistance for job creation.
They undertake to guarantee protection of all the rights recognized under existing legislation
of migrants legally resident in their respective territories;
in the area of illegal immigration they decide to establish closer cooperation. In this context,
the partners, aware of their responsibility for readmission, agree to adopt the relevant
provisions and measures, by means of bilateral agreements or arrangements, in order to
readmit their nationals who are in an illegal situation. To that end, the Member States of the
European Union take citizens to mean nationals of the Member States, as defined for
Community purposes;
they agree to strengthen cooperation by means of various measures to prevent terrorism and
fight it more effectively together;
by the same token they consider it necessary to fight jointly and effectively against drug
trafficking, international crime and corruption;
they underline the importance of waging a determined campaign against racism, xenophobia
and intolerance and agree to cooperate to that end.

Follow-up to the conference
The participants:
considering that the Barcelona Conference provides the basis for a process, which is open
and should develop;
reaffirming their will to establish a partnership based on the principles and objectives defined
in this Declaration;
resolved to give practical expression to this EuroMediterranean partnership;
convinced that, in order to achieve this objective, it is necessary to continue the
comprehensive dialogue thus initiated and to carry out a series of specific actions;
hereby adopt the attached work programme:
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs will meet periodically in order to monitor the application of
this Declaration and define actions enabling the objectives of the partnership to be achieved.

The various activities will be followed by ad hoc thematic meetings of ministers, senior
officials and experts, exchanges of experience and information, contacts between those
active in civil society and by any other appropriate means.
Contacts between parliamentarians, regional authorities, local authorities and the social
partners will be encouraged.
A "EuroMediterranean Committee for the Barcelona process" at senior-official level,
consisting of the European Union Troïka and one representative of each Mediterranean
partner, will hold regular meetings to prepare the meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs,
take stock of and evaluate the followup to the Barcelona process and all its components and
update the work programme.
Appropriate preparatory and followup work for the meetings resulting from the Barcelona
work programme and from the conclusions of the "EuroMediterranean Committee for the
Barcelona process" will be undertaken by the Commission departments.
The next meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs will be held in the first semester of 1997
in one of the twelve Mediterranean partners of the European Union, to be determined
through further consultations.
Annex : Work Programme
I. Introduction
The aim of this programme is to implement the objectives of the Barcelona Declaration, and
to respect its principles, through regional and multilateral actions. It is complementary both to
the bilateral cooperation, implemented in particular under the agreements between the EU
and its Mediterranean partners, and to the cooperation already existing in other multilateral
fora.
The preparation and the follow-up to the various actions will be implemented in accordance
with the principles and mechanisms set out in the Barcelona Declaration.
The priority actions for further cooperation are listed below. This does not exclude EuroMediterranean cooperation being extended to other actions if the partners so agree.
The actions may apply to States, their local and regional authorities as well as actors of their
civil society.
With the agreement of the participants, other countries or organizations may be involved in
the actions contained in the work programme. The implementation must take place in a
flexible and transparent way.
With the agreement of the participants, future EuroMediterranean cooperation will take
account, as appropriate, of the opinions and recommendations resulting from the relevant
discussions held at various levels in the region.
The implementation of the programme should start as soon as practical after the Barcelona
Conference. It will be reviewed at the next EuroMediterranean Conference on the basis of a
report to be prepared by the European Commission departments, particularly on the basis of
reports from the various meetings and Groups mentioned below, and approved by the "EuroMediterranean Committee for the Barcelona process" set up by the Barcelona Declaration.

II. Political and Security Partnership: Establishing a common area of peace and
stability
With a view to contributing to the objective of progressively creating a zone of peace, stability
and security in the Mediterranean, senior officials will meet periodically, starting within the
first quarter of 1996. They will:
- conduct a political dialogue to examine the most appropriate means and methods of
implementing the principles adopted by the Barcelona Declaration, and
- submit practical proposals in due time for the next EuroMediterranean Meeting of Foreign
Ministers.
Foreign policy institutes in the EuroMediterranean region will be encouraged to establish a
network for more intensive cooperation which could become operational as of 1996.
III. Economic and Financial Partnership: Building a zone of shared prosperity
Meetings will take place periodically at the level of Ministers, officials or experts, as
appropriate, to promote cooperation in the following areas. These meetings may be
supplemented, where appropriate, by conferences or seminars involving the private sector
likewise.
Establishment of a EuroMediterranean Free Trade Area
The establishment of a free trade area in accordance with the principles contained in the
Barcelona Declaration is an essential element of the EuroMediterranean partnership.
Cooperation will focus on practical measures to facilitate the establishment of free trade as
well as its consequences, including:
- harmonizing rules and procedures in the customs field, with a view in particular to the
progressive introduction of cumulation of origin; in the meantime, favourable consideration
will be given, where appropriate, to finding ad hoc solutions in particular cases;
- harmonization of standards, including meetings arranged by the European Standards
Organisations;
- elimination of unwarranted technical barriers to trade in agricultural products and adoption
of relevant measures related to planthealth and veterinary rules as well as other legislation
on foodstuffs;
- cooperation among statistics organizations with a view to providing reliable data on a
harmonized basis;
- possibilities for regional and subregional cooperation (without prejudice to initiatives taken
in other existing fora).
Investment
The object of cooperation will be to help create a climate favourable to the removal of
obstacles to investment, by giving greater thought to the definition of such obstacles and to
means, including in the banking sector, of promoting such investment.
Industry
Industrial modernisation and increased competitiveness will be key factors for the success of
the EuroMediterranean partnership. In this context, the private sector will play a more

important role in the economic development of the region and the creation of employment.
Cooperation will focus on:
- the adaptation of the industrial fabric to the changing international environment, in particular
to the emergence of the information society;
- the framework for and the preparation of the modernisation and restructuring of existing
enterprises, especially in the public sector, including privatisation;
- the use of international or European standards and the upgrading of conformity testing,
certification, accreditation and quality standards.
Particular attention will be paid to means of encouraging cooperation among SMEs and
creating the conditions for their development, including the possibility of organising
workshops, taking account of experience acquired under MED-INVEST and inside the
European Union.
Agriculture
While pointing out that such matters are covered under bilateral relations in the main,
cooperation in this area will focus on:
- support for policies implemented by them to diversify production;
- reduction of food dependency;
- promotion of environmentfriendly agriculture;
- closer relations between businesses, groups and organizations representing trades and
professions in the partner States on a voluntary basis;
- support for privatization;
- technical assistance and training;
- harmonization of planthealth and veterinary standards;
- integrated rural development, including improvement of basic services and the development
of associated economic activities;
- cooperation among rural regions, exchange of experience and knowhow concerning rural
development;
- development of regions affected by the eradication of illicit crops.
Transport
Efficient interoperable transport links between the EU and its Mediterranean partners, and
among the partners themselves, as well as free access to the market for services in
international maritime transport, are essential to the development of trade patterns and the
smooth operation of the EuroMediterranean partnership.
The Transport Ministers of Western Mediterranean countries met twice in 1995 and, following
the Regional Conference for the Development of Maritime Transport in the Mediterranean,
the Mediterranean Waterborne Transport Working Group adopted a multiannual programme.

Cooperation will focus on:
- development of an efficient Trans-Mediterranean multimodal combined sea and air
transport system, through the improvement and modernization of ports and airports, the
suppression of unwarranted restrictions, the simplification of procedures, the improvement of
maritime and air safety, the harmonization of environmental standards at a high level
including more efficient monitoring of maritime pollution, and the development of harmonized
traffic management systems;
- development of east-west land links on the southern and eastern shores of the
Mediterranean, and
- connection of Mediterranean transport networks to the Trans-European Network in order to
ensure their interoperability.
Energy
A high-level Conference was held in Tunisia in 1995 with a followup meeting in Athens and
an Energy Conference in Madrid on 20 November 1995.
With a view to creating appropriate conditions for investment in and activities by energy
companies, future cooperation will focus, inter alia on:
- fostering the association of Mediterranean countries with the Treaty on the European
Energy Charter;
- energy planning;
- encouraging producer-consumer dialogue;
- oil and gas exploration, refining, transportation, distribution, and regional and trans-regional
trade;
- coal production and handling;
- generation and transmission of power and interconnection and development of networks;
- energy efficiency;
- new and renewable sources of energy;
- energy-related environmental issues;
- development of joint research programmes;
- training and information activities in the energy sector.
Telecommunications and information technology
With a view to developing a modern, efficient telecommunications network, cooperation will
focus on:
- information and telecommunications infrastructures (minimum regulatory framework,
standards, conformity testing, network interoperability, etc.);
- regional infrastructures including links with European networks;
- access to services, and
- new services in priority fields of application.

Intensification of EuroMediterranean exchanges and access to the nascent information
society will be facilitated by more efficient information and communications infrastructures.
A regional conference is planned for 1996 with the aim of paving the way for pilot projects to
show the concrete benefits of the information society.
Regional planning
Cooperation will focus on:
- defining a regional planning strategy for the EuroMediterranean area commensurate with
the countries' requirements and special features;
- promoting cross-border cooperation in areas of mutual interest.
Tourism
The Ministers for Tourism, meeting in Casablanca, adopted the Mediterranean Tourism
Charter in 1995. The cooperation actions to be initiated will relate in particular to information,
promotion and training.
Environment
Cooperation will focus on:
- assessing environmental problems in the Mediterranean region and defining, where
appropriate, the initiatives to be taken;
- making proposals to establish and subsequently update a short and mediumterm priority
environmental action programme for intervention coordinated by the European Commission
and supplemented by longterm actions; it should include among the main areas for action,
the following: integrated management of water, soil and coastal areas; management of
waste; preventing and combating air pollution and pollution in the Mediterranean sea; natural
heritage, landscapes and site conservation and management; Mediterranean forest
protection, conservation and restoration, in particular through the prevention and control of
erosion, soil degradation,
forest fires and combating desertification; transfer of Community experience in financing
techniques, legislation and environmental monitoring; integration of environmental concerns
in all policies;
- setting up a regular dialogue to monitor the implementation of the action programme;
- reinforcing regional and subregional cooperation and strengthening coordination with the
Mediterranean Action Plan;
- stimulating coordination of investments from various sources, and implementation of
relevant international conventions;
- promoting the adoption and implementation of legislation and regulatory measures when
required, especially preventive measures and appropriate high standards.
Science and Technology
Cooperation will focus on:
- promoting research and development and tackling the problem of the widening gap in
scientific achievement, taking account of the principle of mutual advantage;

- stepping up exchanges of experience in the scientific sectors and policies which might best
enable the Mediterranean partners to reduce the gap between them and their European
neighbours and to promote the transfer of technology.
- helping train scientific and technical staff by increasing participation in joint research
projects.
Following the Ministerial meeting at Sophia Antipolis in March 1995, a Monitoring Committee
was set up; this Committee will meet for the first time immediately after the Barcelona
Conference. It will focus on making recommendations for the joint implementation of the
policy priorities agreed at Ministerial level.
Water
The Mediterranean Water Charter was adopted in Rome in 1992.
Water is a priority issue for all the Mediterranean partners and will gain in importance as
water scarcity becomes more pressing. The purpose of cooperation in this area will be as
follows:
- to take stock of the situation taking into account current and future needs;
- to identify ways of reinforcing regional cooperation;
- to make proposals for rationalising the planning and management of water resources,
where appropriate on a joint basis;
- to contribute towards the creation of new sources of water.
Fisheries
In view of the importance of conservation and rational management of Mediterranean fish
stocks, cooperation in the framework of the General Fisheries Council for the Mediterranean
will be reinforced.
Following the Ministerial Fisheries Conference held in Heraklion in 1994, appropriate followup action will be taken in the legal sphere through meetings to take place in 1996.
Cooperation will be improved on research into fish stocks, including aquaculture, as well as
into training and scientific research.
IV. Partnership in Social, Cultural and Human affairs : Developing Human Resources,
Promoting Understanding between Cultures and Exchanges between Civil Societies
Development of human resources
The EuroMediterranean partnership must contribute to enhancing educational levels
throughout the region, whilst laying special emphasis on the Mediterranean partners. To this
end, a regular dialogue on educational policies will take place, initially focusing on vocational
training, technology in education, the universities and other highereducation establishments
and research. In this context as well as in other areas, particular attention will be paid to the
role of women. The Euro-Arab Business School in Granada and the European Foundation in
Turin will also contribute to this cooperation.
A meeting of representatives of the vocational training sector (policy makers, academics,
trainers, etc) will be organised with the aim of sharing modern management approaches.
A meeting will be held of representatives of universities and highereducation establishments.
The European Commission will strengthen its ongoing MEDCampus programme.

A meeting will also be called on the subject of technology in education.
Municipalities and Regions
Municipalities and regional authorities need to be closely involved in the operation of the
EuroMediterranean Partnership. City and regional representatives will be encouraged to
meet each year to take stock of their common challenges and exchange experiences. This
will be organised by the European Commission and will take account of previous experience.
Dialogue between cultures and civilizations
Given the importance of improving mutual understanding by promoting cultural exchanges
and knowledge of languages, officials and experts will meet in order to make concrete
proposals for action, inter alia, in the following fields: cultural and creative heritage, cultural
and artistic events, co-productions (theatre and cinema), translations and other means of
cultural dissemination, training.
Greater understanding among the major religions present in the EuroMediterranean region
will facilitate greater mutual tolerance and cooperation. Support will be given to periodic
meetings of representatives of religions and religious institutions as well as theologians,
academics and others concerned, with the aim of breaking down prejudice, ignorance and
fanaticism and fostering cooperation at grassroots level. The conferences held in Stockholm
(15/17.6.1995) and Toledo (4/7.11.1995) may serve as examples in this context.
Media
Close interaction between the media will work in favour of better cultural understanding. The
European Union will actively promote such interaction, in particular through the ongoing
MED-Media programme. An annual meeting of representatives of the media will be
organised in this context.
Youth
Youth exchanges should be the means to prepare future generations for a closer cooperation
between the EuroMediterranean partners. A EuroMediterranean youth exchange programme
should therefore be established based on experience acquired in Europe and taking account
of the partners' needs; this programme should take account of the importance of vocational
training, particularly for those without qualifications, and of the training of organizers and
social workers in the youth field. The European Commission will make the necessary
proposals before the next meeting of EuroMediterranean Foreign Ministers.
Exchanges between Civil Societies
Senior officials will meet periodically to discuss measures likely to facilitate human
exchanges resulting from the EuroMediterranean partnership, especially those involving
officials, scientists, academics, businessmen, students and sportsmen, including the
improvement and simplification of administrative procedures, particularly where unnecessary
administrative obstacles might exist.
Social Development
The EuroMediterranean partnership must contribute to improving the living and working
conditions and increasing the employment level of the population in the Mediterranean
partner States, in particular of women and the neediest strata of the population. In this
context the partners attach particular importance to the respect and promotion of basic social
rights. To that end, actors in social policies will meet periodically at the appropriate level.

Health
The partners agree to concentrate cooperation in this area on:
- action on raising awareness, information and prevention;
- development of public health services, in particular health care, primary health centres,
maternal and child health care services, family planning, epidemiological supervision
systems and measures to control communicable diseases;
- training of health and health-administration personnel;
- medical cooperation in the event of natural disasters.
Migration
Given the importance of the issue of migration for EuroMediterranean relations, meetings will
be encouraged in order to make proposals concerning migration flows and pressures. These
meetings will take account of experience acquired, inter alia, under the MED-Migration
programme, particularly as regards improving the living conditions of migrants legally
established in the Union.
- Terrorism
- Drug Trafficking, Organised crime
Fighting terrorism will have to be a priority for all the parties. To that end, officials will meet
periodically with the aim of strengthening cooperation among police, judicial and other
authorities. In this context, consideration will be given, in particular, to stepping up
exchanges of information and improving extradition procedures.
Officials will meet periodically to discuss practical measures which can be taken to improve
cooperation among police, judicial, customs, administrative and other authorities in order to
combat, in particular, drug trafficking and organised crime, including smuggling.
All these meetings will be organized with due regard for the need for a differentiated
approach that takes into account the diversity of the situation in each country.
Illegal Immigration
Officials will meet periodically to discuss practical measures which can be taken to improve
cooperation among police, judicial, customs, administrative and other authorities in order to
combat illegal immigration.
These meetings will be organized with due regard for the need for a differentiated approach
that takes into account the diversity of the situation in each country.
V. Institutional contacts
EuroMediterranean Parliamentary Dialogue
An Inter-Parliamentary Conference on Security and Cooperation in the Mediterranean was
held in Valletta from 1 to 4 November 1995. The European Parliament is invited to take the
initiative with other parliaments concerning the future EuroMediterranean Parliamentary
Dialogue, which could enable the elected representatives of the partners to exchange ideas
on a wide range of issues.

Other institutional contacts
Regular contacts among other European organs, in particular the Economic and Social
Committee of the European Community, and their Mediterranean counterparts, would
contribute to a better understanding of the major issues relevant in the EuroMediterranean
partnership.
To this end, the Economic and Social Committee is invited to take the initiative in
establishing links with its Mediterranean counterparts and equivalent bodies. In this context,
a EuroMediterranean meeting of Economic and Social Committees and equivalent bodies
will take place in Madrid on 12 and 13 December.
