THE ROUTES OF AL-ANDALUS:
SPIRITUAL CONVERGENCE AND INTERCULTURAL DIALOGUE

The whole world in all its diversity is one, and all men are brothers and neighbours”
(Al-Zubeidi, tutor to Al-Hakam II)

Ever since its foundation, UNESCO has striven to foster dialogue between cultures as fundamental to
the building a culture of peace. The international co-operation which developed from this inspired the
concept of mankind's "common heritage”, promoted greater knowledge of other peoples and mobilized
intellectual communities to support projects highlighting cultural diversity and interaction.

Though much has been done, there is still an imperative need to strengthen intercultural dialogue. The
complex processes at work in the present-day world are creating a momentum that is highly dangerous
- as can be seen from numerous ongoing conflicts - but are also quite capable of stimulating convergences
between cultures which will bring to light a number of shared values.

UNESCO is therefore striving to place the emphasis on contemporary convergence processes, to find
more and more meeting points for dialogue between communities belonging to different cultural or
religious traditions, to draw attention to the ways in which they borrow from and contribute to each
other, and to encourage new ways of looking at each other and a deeper sense of solidarity.

Against this background, the "Routes of al-Andalus” project, approved by UNESCO's General
Conference at its twenty-eighth session in November 1995, seeks to highlight the processes, mechanisms
and heritage of dialogue that gradually developed in medieval Spain, and to study the consequences today
of the interactions that took place in that context. Islamic, Christian and Jewish cultures and religions
coexisted for nearly eight centuries in al-Andalus, though admittedly within a complex historical setting
marked by divisions and violence; but that in no way diminishes its exceptional nature. Al-Andalus
provided an outstanding environment for dialogue and contact.

That form of coexistence, unparalleled at the time, was destined to have wide-ranging consequences. It
was not only the Iberian peninsula and the Maghrib, but also sub-Saharan Africa and Western Europe,
that were enriched. Through al-Andalus, the foundations of Greek culture and the contributions to
philosophy and science of India, Persia and China were disseminated in Europe. The Spain of al-Andalus
thus served as a link between East and West and between Antiquity and the future Renaissance.

But the aim of UNESCO is also to build bridges. Bridges between Judaism, Christianity and Islam;
between the West, the Arab world and sub-Saharan Africa; between the past and the present, to shape å
future of mutual exchange and respect between peoples, cultures and religions which, in former times
and in spite of difficulties, succeeded in living together and enriching each other.

EL LEGADO ANDALUSI:
"THE ROUTES OF AL-ANDALUS”

Each day we hear more spoken about al-Andalus, of its artistic and social creations, its music, arquitectural
achievements, science, philosophy and of its influence in the transmission of Greek and Roman thought to
the rest of Europe. As åa place of interchange, a melting-pot of cultures, races and religions, its capacity for
tolerance and coexistence created å society which showed its greatest radiance in the Middle Ages.

In Andalusia, three cultures derived from three religions have coexisted in spite of all obstacles. The
theological and cultural representations, the actual rhetoric forms between the distinct religions and
communities, have as their origin the debates and controversies of the period.

The Andalusian Regional Government, by way of El Legado Andalusi, is fulfilling å labour of recovery and
diffusion of our Andalusian past. One of our objectives is to promote inter-cultural dialogue as å
fundamental factor in the creation of å culture which is more just and solid, a culture of peace. Cooperation
and interchange with international organisations like UNESCO allows the emergence of this notion of å
patrimony common to all humanity, improves mutual knowledge between cultures, and mobilizes groups ot
intellectuals around projects which develop diversity and cultural interaction.

In this context of a constantly renewed intercultural dialogue, the Andalusian Regional Government
promotes the creation of areas of dialogue between communities which belong to different cultural and
religious groups but who share a common historical patrimony, to stimulate the manifestation of certain
universal values. It is a question of emphasising the reciprocal contributions made by the cultures, and study
in more depth the notions of "otherness”, the viewpoint of others, and solidarity.

We consider the global programme * The Routes of al-Andalus: spiritual convergence and intercultural dialogue” a
necessary and estimable initiative. The study and analysis of the mechanism's dynamics of breaking-off and
convergence in what al-Andalus was, should be the impulse to create new areas of dialogue between cultures
and civilizations.

This interchange between cultures can serve to bring today to the world specific keys for a better
understanding between communities and to establish bonds of solidarity which contribute to å better future.

INTRODUGTION

Doudou DIENE
Director of the Division for Intercultural Projects
Division for UNESCO

In a limited geographical setting - the Iberian Peninsula, over a considerable period of time - more than
seven centuries, three regions - the Arab world, Europe and Africa, and three religions - Islam, Judaism
and Christianity, all came together, setting the scene for one of history's most prodigious intercultural
dialogues. This conjunction of history, geography, culture and religion transtormed medieval Spain into
"al-Andalus”, a nexus of human, cultural and spiritual interactions which left an imprint so deep that it
cannot be ignored by anyone wishing to understand the long term implications of Christian Europe's
perceptions of and its relations with the Arab-Islamic, Judaic and African worlds.

The cultural outcome of that encounter is well
known: an aesthetic approach and artistic Åiio de las Naciones Unidas para la I olerancia

creations exemplified by the Alhambra in
Granada, and the music and poetry of al-Andalus.
However, it is precisely this all but exclusive
highlighting of aesthetics and of the art of living
that presents å problem. In the first place this is
because the aesthetic of al-Andalus and its artistic
expressions have come to overshadow the ethical
dimension, the values and points of convergence
in the collective memory, if not in that of the
scholarly community; but also and above all
because of the all but exclusively historical
interest in this unparalleled experience, which
does not take account of all the lessons that could
be drawn from it.

If we are to gain aå better understanding of the
experience of al-Andalus, it is vital to delve into
the long memory of the interlocking
mechanisms and processes which for several centuries enabled three cultural complexes and three religions
to practise in vitro an art of coexistence in which conflict and dialogue merged in a fruitful give-and-take.

To speak of a long memory - and that is the underlying meaning of the concept of "routes” - is precisely
to ponder and probe the hidden linkages formed in medieval times with the help of the questions,
perceptions and practices of these three religions and these cultures in modern times.

Ultimately, the goal of the "Routes of al-Andalus” project is to enable history and modernity, values
and arts, to come together in order to build and consolidate, here and now, a Culture of Peace - the
new idea launched by the Director-General of UNESCO. To read the story running like filigree
through the relations between human beings and between religions, linking war and peace, trade and
culture, is to illuminate - in the spirit of UNESCO's own mandate - through åa more radical
reappropriation of the experience of al-Andalus, the gradual construction of a plural identity and å
common heritage, the understanding of whose mechanisms may perhaps enable us to find better
answers to the questions currently affecting relations between Islam, Judaism and Christianity, the
Arab world, Europe and Africa...

Its depth and duration were major features that made the Spain that was al-Andalus a "live” cultural
field, metaphorically switched on. It was because the political and the military dimensions, the forces
of antagonism and of attraction, had to be transmuted, resolved or translated into å constant process
of cultural invention, that al-Andalus reached a cultural "critical mass” which literally radiated out
through space and time.

We must as åa matter of urgency ensure that, thanks to its special radiance, the Spain of al-Andalus is not
seen solely as an aesthetic scene from long ago, but is perceived and experienced as an intercultural
dialogue whose relevance to today's world is acknowledged by all.

In the final analysis, UNESCO's response to the prevailing doctrine of the clash of civilizations is to
highlight, in order to construct "the defences of peace in the minds of men”, the dynamic process of
mutual nourishment of cultures which also obeys the old law of energy: "nothing is created, nothing is
lost, all is transformed”.

DIALOGUES BETWEEN RELIGIONS IN ANDALUSIA

Haim ZAFRANI

The dialogue of ideas, cultures and religions, which is of such major interest to us today, has its roots in
the distant past, in Biblical wisdom literature, which, being essentially universalist, supra-historical in
character and a source of monotheism, provided an important point of contact between ancient
civilizations and peoples, such as the Jews and the Arabs.

The Arab conquests between 632 and 711 created an immense area in the western Mediterranean which
united under the banner of Islam peoples who had previously been subject to the empires of Persia,
Byzantium and Rome. The distinctive way
of life that developed in the Umayyad and
Abbasid periods lasted for eight centuries in
the Muslim West, in the fertile lands of
North Africa and Andalusia, until 1492. It
has survived in the Judaeo-Muslim historical
and cultural consciousness over the four
centuries since that tragic date and remains
as åa major point of reference and å model to

be followed.

Taking the collation of parallel Jewish and
Islamic writings as our starting-point, we
have scrutinized the texts that have helped
to transmit cultures, civilization and indeed
wisdom, dissecting their authors' way of
thinking so as to reveal similarities and the
elements of å symbiotic relationship for which there is no parallel during the more than 1,500 years
of Jewish life in Christian countries, apart from a few brief periods in the history of Spain, the
inheritor of Arab civilization, when some of its monarchs proclaimed themselves emperor of two or
three religions!.

Accordingly, we have constructed models and delineated the areas in which Jews, Christians and
Muslims were most fully and freely able to engage in a wide range of common activities. They include
the socio-economic, linguistic and literary, philosophical, theological and even religious fields, mystical
and cabalistic practices, the law and administration, folklore, poetry and music, and other social
activities marked by the imprint of religion and magic (including rites of passage such as birth,
marriage and death).

Two outstanding figures of the Hispano-Maghribi Golden Age:
Averroés and Maimonides

Averroés and Maimonides, who were both born in Cördoba, had their roots in the same civilization, in
the same symbiotic society and in a culture which had at that time reached a very high degree of
sophistication and was at its peak. They were both experts in legal science, both doctors and both
philosophers. They were also contemporaries. (Maimonides lived from 1135 to 1204 and Averroés from
1126 to 1198) and thus both lived under the regime that had been established by the Almohad dynasty.

They lived parallel lives (in Plutarch's meaning of the term) and although their paths never crossed and

| . rn td | they never even met they followed exactly the same course as
SQ regards their intellectual activities and even their professional
careers - and perhaps also as regards the religious repression
they both suffered. Here I am thinking, in the case of Averroés,
mainly of doctrinal questions, even though he lived at the
Almohad court and carried out official duties, while in the case
of Maimonides it was because he was Jewish and did not
belong to the dominant religion.

Averroés occupied the posts of qadi (judge) and chief gadi (qadi
al-quda), åa mainly religious function im Muslim society,
requiring a thorough knowledge of the revealed law, its
theological developments and legal and jurisprudential
implications.

Averroés was, moreover, å philosopher, and in that capacity, had
been requested by the caliph to interpret Aristotle. In addition

Monument to Averroés in Cordoba to what may be termed these spiritual and intellectual
responsibilities he also had temporal duties as royal physician, attached to the person of the Almohad
sovereign, Abu Ya'qub Yusuf. It is worth pointing out that these three major functions are paralleled in the
life of Maimonides, who was also a master of legal science and a pillar of the halakhan (rabbinical law), å
philosopher and å doctor at the royal court in Fostat.

The philosophical model

Clearly the way in which Jewish philosophy flourished in the Islamic world has attracted å great deal of
attention. It gave rise to a philosophical model which it is, however, by no means easy to distinguish from
other models and approaches and from other forms of expression and thought, with theological, mystical,
ethical, poetical and even legal and political elements, which are interrelated in varying degrees according
to the dominant characteristics of each work. Outstanding examples of this are provided by the works of

10

such figures as Sa'adia, Ibn Gabirol, Bahya Ibn Paquda, Maimonides, Judah ha-Levi and their Muslim
counterparts, al-Kindi, al-Farabi, Ibn Sina, al-Ghazali, [bn Bajjah, Ibn Tufayl, Ibn Rushd (Averroés), etc.

As far as philosophy is concerned, one of the most striking
features of the J[udaeo-Arab symbiosis is the "Hellenization of
Jewish thought through the intermediary of Islam” .The relations of
a great number of Diaspora Jews with the Greco-Latin world,
despite the importance of Philo of Alexandria, had only a
superficial influence. However, just as Jewish translators had
passed on Arab science and philosophy to the Christian world,
so it was through the writings of the Arabs that Greek science
and ways of thinking penetrated the Jewish universe.

Jewish philosophical thought followed the same intellectual
path as Islamic thought, adopting the most advanced findings
of the new sciences and maintaining friendly relations, while
at the same time conserving an attitude of independence on
the fundamental questions of religion. This has enabled the Statue of Maimonides

great works of the theologians and philosophers of the tenth, eleventh and twelfth centuries to remain
classics of orthodox Judaism, in spite of the controversies some of them aroused, in particular The Guide
of the Perplexed?. One figure, among many other philosophers and scholars, may serve as an example:
Samwal al-Maghribi, a Jew who came under the influence of Islam late in life, a scholar and intellectual
of great renown, the creator of new mathematical principles and the author of Algebra al-Bahir. His
mentor was a twelfth-century Jewish thinker, Abu al-Barakat al-Baghdadi, called Awhad al-Zamam,
"Unique of his generation”, whose critique of Aristotle's Physica foreshadowed modern science.
Converted very late in his life to Islam, he was considered to be one of the greatest Islamic
philosophers of all time.

Mysticism: å wellspring of wisdom

It was through Sufism that many Jewish ascetics and mystics came into contact with å particular form of
spirituality which they passed on to Jewish culture and to its ethical system, initially in Arabic, but
subsequently in translations into Hebrew and other Jewish vernacular languages. They included Bahya Ibn
Paquda, Abraham Abulafya, Abraham and Obadya, the son and grandson of Maimonides, and many others.

The writings on Ibn *Arabi and the practices of Andalusian Sufism bring out the points of contact and the
similarities and reveal the existence of areas where Jewish and Muslim esotericism and spirituality converge.

The teachings of al-Ghazali had immense repercussions and exerted considerable influence on the history
of thought, in both East and West, among the elites of Europe, especially among Jewish thinkers and
authors, for whom, his works and teachings provided a lesson to be learnt and his spiritual experience an

example to be followed. This influence operated on two levels and covered two periods. During the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries, it was exercised over Jewish authors who thought and wrote in Arabic.
Such was the case of Judah ha-Levi, who was the first to accept the teachings of the master and his most
fervent disciple, employing from the very beginning the accusation of incoherence which al-Ghazali had
made against philosophers in general and Aristotelian philosophy in particular, since, like him, he
perceived the great danger it posed for the revealed religions. Faithful to the master's thinking, he quoted
directly from his texts, using an early story which al-Ghazali had included in his Ihyaulum al-Din and
which summarized the doctrinal bases on the dogmas he taught. It is generally accepted that Maimonides
knew al-Ghazali's works and had read his Tahafut al-falasifa. What is surprising, however is that the code
of Maimonides, the Mishne Torah, the only work he wrote in Hebrew, presents on analysis remarkable
similarities with al-Ghazali's Ihya ulum al-Din. Both these works, which as exclusively legal-religious in
essence, but intended to some extent to revitalize the religious sciences, cover many similar subjects and
both begin with a substantial prologue bearing the same title, "The Book of Knowledge”, Sefer ha-madda
in the first case and Kitab al- ilm in the second.

The spiritual theology of Bahya Ibn Paquda
and its affinities with that of Ibn *Arabi

The first of these writers, Bahya Ibn Paquda, a major figure in his own right who had considerable
influence on later Jewish spirituality and whose own teachings were greatly influenced by Islamic
mysticism, was an Andalusian Jew of the latter half of the eleventh century, whose famous work
Guidance to the Duties of the Heart rapidly became a very popular book of devotion in eastern and
western Judaism in its translation into Hebrew and the Jewish languages of East and West, including
the Judaeo-Arabic of the Maghrib3.

The literary structure and the ascetic ideas Bahya developed in this work of pietism derive from
Sufism, that is to say, from the very sources of Islamic mysticism.

The spiritual theology which Bahya constructed for his co-religionists mainly drew on Islamic sources,
even in areas where he could have found similar elements in his own religious tradition. Thus, he
borrowed from Islamic mysticism the idea of a journey leading the soul to pure divine love and to
union with the "supreme light” of God and he chose to employ an ideological framework, åa mystical
structure, and a style which matched the tastes of his Jewish readers who were profoundly influenced
by Arabic literature ...

Thus, Bahya's works represents a deliberate attempt, marked by deep understanding, to adopt Islamic
mysticism to Jewish spirituality.

As å manual of the inner life of å very pure and elevated spirituality, and an introduction to the duties of
the heart, it is also valuable testimony to the astonishing receptiveness of the Jewish mind which, not content

3. Bahya wrote this book in Arabic, entitling it Kitab al-Hidaya ”ila fara”id al-qulub. It is worth noting in this respect that Al-Ghazali, in his Mizam
al Amal "Criteria of Action”, pays a lot of attention to "the science of the heart” inherited from Al-Hasan al-Basri.

12

with assimilating the heritage of Greek thought as transmitted and enriched by the Muslims, also set out to
extract from Islamic asceticism what it could incorporate within the framework of its own beliefs.

Bahya seems to have been inspired by ascetic work (zuhd) of eastern origin. In that respect, as in others,
the West was still dependent on the East and Muslim Spain in the eleventh century was familiar through
the works of a number of such writers with a strand of asceticism which circulated freely in the Islamic
world.

The ten principles of the Kitab al-hidayah ila faraid al-qulub
(Guidance to the Duties of the Heart) are stated by its author at
the outset in the plan he himself laid out for the book: å sincere
profession of the oneness of God (ikhlas al-tawhid), consideration
for all created beings (al-i'tibar bilmakhlugin), obedience to God
(ta'at Allah), abandonment (tawakkul, the principle of giving oneself
entirely to Him), sincerity of action (ikhlas), humility (tawadu'),
repentance (fawba), constant examination of one's conscience
(muhasaba), abstinence and asceticism (zuhd), and love of God

(mahabba).

poets learnt their art. Jewish poetry owes the main features of its

prosody to the rich heritage of the Andalusian Golden Age, its metre being, despite the constraints
imposed by the Hebrew language, a relic of Arabic metre.

Å "treatise on the art of poetry”, intended to pass on to Hebrew poetry the lessons of Arabic rhetoric,
was written by Moses Ibn Ezra (1070-1140), *an illustrious poet in Hebrew and å Jewish scholar of
Arabic” for whom *the art of correct expression had become the special prerogative of the Arab world
as a whole”.*The Arabic language”, wrote a poet whom he quoted, "is to other languages as spring Is to
the other seasons”. It was an opinion contested by other Jewish writers for whom the literary pre-
eminence of Hebrew literature and the Scriptures remained unquestioned.

Arab-Andalusian musical traditions
in Jewish society

Arab thinkers and musicologists had produced many works of musical theory, well known to the Jewish
elites, who included many composers and theoreticians, and indeed Maimonides himself was not
indifferent to theories propounded on the therapeutic value of music in certain cases of mental illness.
One contemporary, in the, treatise "Medicine of souls”, recommended that one whole year - the eighth
of the ten making up the course of academic studies - be devoted to music. On more that one occasion,
Muslim princes had recourse to the talents of Jewish musicians and singers on festive or solemn occasions.
It is worth noting that in the Maghrib, in Morocco in particular, "the Muslim and Jewish communities
have piously conserved the memory of Hispano-Arab music, which emigrated with them from the
Iberian cities they were forced to leave”.

Ås an outstanding example of the dialogue between different religions, cultures and civilizations,
Andalusia represents a lesson for us today as we confront globalization, which needs to take place against
a background of enlightened social relations and the universal ethical values in which humanity has its
roots and without which it cannot survive.

There is also a message for contemporary societies in the universal wisdom contained in the scriptures,
whether they be the Old Testament, The New Testament or the Koran. This involves seeking out the
universal values enshrined in the Creation and in our relations with all created beings, by living in
harmony and sharing with others and pursuing the quest for values and forms of behaviour that will
result in a little more justice, responsibility, generosity and love.

AL-ANDALUS: TOLERANGE AND CONVERGENGE

Mohamed BENCHRIFA

Throughout the period of Islamic rule al-Andalus was a remarkable example and outstanding model of
tolerance. It emerged at the time of the conquest, when the Muslim conquerors undertook to preserve

the freedoms of their subjects, protect their fortunes and their property, respect their churches and ensure
their defence.

The agreement concluded between ”Abdul”aziz ibn Miåså ibn Nusair and Theodomir is a case in point.
Similarly, the story told by historians of Ardabat and Maimun al-”Åbid is about the practical application
of written agreements. It demonstrates in the clearest possible way of the generosity of the conquerors'
conduct and policy towards the vanquished in the age of the Governors (the wulåh), which resulted in å
perfectly harmonious cohabitation and å model of peaceful coexistence between the different races and
religions.

One of the consequences was that the Arabic language and literature became widespread among
Christians and Jews, starting at the time of the Umayyad emirate and intensifying under the Caliphate.
This rapid process of arabization, which took place åa century or a little more after the arrival of the
Muslims in the Iberian peninsula, provoked lamentations from some churchmen, the most famous of
whom was Ålvaro, a priest at Cördoba.

This situation probably arose not only as a result of the climate of tolerance, referred to above, but out of
the ambitions of Christians and Jews at that time to occupy state positions and accede to posts in
government service. In this connection, it is known that the Umayyads of al-Andalus, following the example
of their predecessors from the Fast, employed many Christians in their various offices, some of whom
achieved the highest rank under the princes and caliphs. Examples of this are Gomes Rabi", who was close
to al-Hakam ar-Rabdi, and Gomes ibn Antin, first secretary to Abd-al-Rahman an-Nåsir al-Ausat, whose
writing style, quality of correspondence, savoir-faire, and accurate accounting were praised by the great
historian Ibn Hayyån. One further example is Bishop Rabi' ibn Zaid (Recesmundus), who worked with
”Abd-al-Rahman an-Nåsir and was entrusted with various missions and several embassies during his reign.

In this context, a most curious fact should be noted: government services at that period were closed on
Sundays. Thus, the historian Ibn Hayyån writes: "The first to make Sunday a day of rest every week for
the Sultan's secretaries and clerks, now absent from the Palace on this occasion, was Gomes ibn Antun,
Prince Muhammadss letter-writer. He was a Christian and wished to spend this day - that 15, Sunday - at
his devotions. All the secretaries followed his example in order to take some rest and look after their own
affairs, and the habit has continued down to our own times”.

Another instance of tolerance in al-Andalus is the fact that the Muslims usually took part in Christian
festivals, particularly those of the Nativity.

15

Tolerance reached its apogee in the reign of ”Abd-al-Rahman an-Nåsir in whose palace the great
doctors and scholars of the three religions that acknowledge Abraham lived side by side. The scholar,
doctor and man of letters Ibn al-Kattåni, the Jewish doctor Hasdai ibn Shapröt and the Christian
Rabi' ibn Zaid, were assembled there, all of them with the task of studying the book of Dioscorides.

Bishop Rabi'Ibn Zaid and the great scholar of the Hadfth, Qåsim ibn Asbagh, were also engaged in
reviewing the translation of the works of Paulo Orosio. Such collaboration between aå great imåm of

FETT the hadith and the Islamic sciences and a bishop clearly shows the great
spirit of coexistence and tolerance that prevailed in al-Andalus under the
Umayyads. This is confirmed by professor Vernet, the historian of science,
whose objectivity can be relied up on; he writes: "Under the caliphate,
there was great political and religious tolerance. Scholars of various races
and religions collaborated closely: good evidence of this is the patronage
that Hasdai bestowed upon Muslims and Christians, in addition to his
Jewish co-religionists”.

These manifestations of tolerance under the caliphate did not decline
during the period of the taifa kingdoms, and there is no lack of even later
examples, notwithstanding the new situation of confrontation that was to
put an end to cohabitation in Islamic al-Andalus and lead later to the

Arabic version of the establishment of the courts of the Inquisition.
Materia Médica of Dioscorides

The existence of Christian communities in Andalusian society was unique in the Muslim West, unlike
Jewish communities which were established everywhere.

This situation and the pluralism that went with it had various consequences: the intermixing of races,
bilingualism and multilingualism and, lastly, religious dialogue and debate.

The intermixing of races comes out clearly in marriages between Arabs, non-Arabs (Spaniards) and
Berbers, and is particularly evident in the case of the mothers of the Umayyad princes and caliphs, of
non-Arab Andalusian origin.

Bilingualism and multilingualism affected the language of the natives of al-Andalus and the Hebrew
of the Jews, while everyone vied to be proficient in Arabic, a language in which authors, writers and
poets of all races and religions distinguished themselves. One of the most celebrated of these was Ibn
Sahl, who was a Jew. Another feature of multilingualism in literature is the kharja (poems) in the
romance language and in Andalusian muwashshaha.

Lastly, it was only natural that this vibrant pluralism of religion should have given rise to religious

dialogue and debate. One of many examples is Ibn Hazm, who is regarded as the founder of
comparative religious history and whose work not only had an impact in his own day, but, as

16

specialists have shown, later influenced critical Christian thought.

Marti.

Another reference we have inherited from the Andalusian religious debate is ”Abdullåh at-Tarjumån's
book. Initially he was å priest called Anselmo Turmeda, from the city of Majorca, Ramon Llull's town;
he converted to Islam and settled in Tunis at the end of the eighth century AH/fourteenth century.
Ramon Lull, as we know, was the leading representative of the Christian community. And, to bring
this century to a close, we will recall that it was in this period that ”Abdulhaqq al-Islåmi, åa converted
Jew, wrote his controvertial book against the rabbis.

In the middle of the ninth century AH/fifteenth century, shortly before the fall of Granada, a Muslim
Andalusian described discussions he had held in Salamanca, Madrid, Valladolid and Segovia in åa book
entitled Risålat as-så”il wa-l-mujfb (The Epistle of the Questioner and the Replier).

Finally, we shall refer to Nåsir ad-Din (The Champion of the Faith) by the Moor Aföqai in which he
relates the misfortunes of his co-religionists and contests the rabbis and priests.

As well as religious debate in al-Andalus there was also debate about racial and ethnic groups. Iwo
works give å comprehensive view of the matter: al-Istihår (The Exposition) and al-Mughålaba (The
Overcoming), defending the cause of the *Slavs” and other slaves of European origin. It should be
noted that Ibn Gharsiya's risåla (epistle) belongs to this school: it gives primacy to non-Arabs and
provoked many replies.

This tradition of religious disputes and theological discussions organised between scholars and
members of the religious communities illustrates complex attitudes: expression of the differences and

willingness to convince and convert "the other”.

In conclusion, it can be said that al-Andalus was home to forms of tolerance that were not seen again until
modern times. It was å genuine land of dialogue, dialogue that was at times serene and at others lively.

THE ALMORAVIDS: AN AFRO-IBERIAN HEGEMONY

York K. FALL

Al-Andalus, with its numerous original cultural characteristics, is a very rare example of å European
territory conquered and governed, from the end of the 11th century to the middle of the 12th century,
by an African dynasty from the south-west of the Sahara and the Senegalo-Nigerian Sahel. The
Almoravid hegemony (from the Arab al-murabitin) thus represents the only historical experience -
albeit ephemeral - of political integration ever formed between West Africa, the Maghrib and the
Iberian Peninsula.

The West African origin of the Almoravid
movement, however, has been largely occulted
given the exclusively mulitary vision of history,
and the tendency of historians to insist, more
than is necessary, upon the wars and the
political and ideological confrontations
between Islam and Christianity. Other aspects
such as the strong presence of black warriors
(free men or slaves) at the time of the
Almoravid hegemony in the Maghrib and in
Spain, or the establishment of an empire, at the
end of the 11th and during the 12th century,
stretching from north to south from the Ebro
to Senegal, have also been overlooked..

The city of Walata in Mauritania

The Almoravids were already firmly established in the Maghrib when, in 1086, they crossed the Straits
of Gibraltar to come to the assistance of the Muslim principalities of Spam and Portugal which were
threatened by the Castilian offensive to reconquer the Peninsula for Christianity.

This departure point in the Maghrib for the conquest of al-Andalus explains the fact that the Almoravid
Empire was only considered from the distorted viewpoint of the series of power substitutions which
marked Ibero-Maghribi history.

The West-African Origins

We are indebted to the contemporary Andalusian geographer, Abu Ubayd Abd Allah al-Bakri of Cordoba
for his Book of itineraries and kingdoms (Kitab al-masalik wa l-mamalik), which is a precious source of
information concerning the Almoravid expansion. Written in journalistic style around the year 1040, this
classical work of historical geography provides a complete panorama of the Senegalo-Nigerian Sahel,

18

and describes the different phases of the birth of the Almoravid hegemony, starting from the south of the
Sahara and the banks of the Senegal river.

Born out of the preachings of a Berber exegete who had settled amongst Berber tribes in the south of
present-day Mauritania, the movement developed very rapidly in the form of åa coalition with Takrur, å
newly Islamised state in the
Senegal valley. It would seem
probable that most of the other
City-States of the Senegalo-
Nigerian Sahel also formed part of
this coalition.

ye

Within two decades, from the
south to the north, the towns and
principalitles of the western
regions of the Sahel and the
Sahara, which took an active part
in controlling the transsaharan
routes, were placed under the
Almoravid administration.
Sijilmasa, an important caravan
city of southern Morocco, then
Awdaghost, the prestigious trading
metropolis in central Mauritania,
were conquered one after the
other. Marrakech was founded in
1070 and became their northern capital and the bastion from which the remainder of Morocco up to
Ceuta, followed by the west of Algeria up to Tlemcen and Oran, were integrated into the Empire.

The principal palm grove of Marrakech

The Almoravids were successful in unifying all the tribes as well as the Saharan and Maghribi tribal
confederations whose latent rivalry and frequent conflicts were an obstacle to stable trading relations and
the safety of the transsaharan caravans.

A Unifying Task

By combining military operations (reconnaissance, skirmishes and lightnening attacks) with an
opportunist policy of matrimonial alliances, clever diplomacy and fanatical proselytism, they contributed
to the establishment and stabilisation of åa Muslim Sahelo-Maghribi area centred on urban cultures.
Very quickly, the "veiled desert warriors” were caught up in Iberian geopolitics. Following the decline of

the central Umayyad power, the unity of Islam in the Peninsula had fragmented with the constitution of

19

some twenty small emirates (the muluk al-tawa”'it or reyes de taifas) all anxious to preserve their
independence.

The disunion, and the intense and enduring conflicts which perpetuated rivalry amongst the emirates, had
enabled the Castilians to conduct a victorious offensive culminating in the conquest of Toledo in 1085.

The Almoravids adapted their strategy to the specificities of Andalusia. While respecting the independence
of their protégés, they successfully mounted three expeditions, from 1086 to 1090, which forced the
troops of Alfonso VI to retreat and stabilized the frontier lines around Toledo and Zaragoza.

The third expedition nevertheless provided å propitious occasion to depose the Caliph and the emurs and
to exile them to the Maghrib, in particular to Marrakech where they were under the surveillance of the
central power. With the integration of all the newly reunited Andalusian territories, the empire's unifying
task was thus completed.

The Almoravid doctrine, essentially Måliki and Sunni, was a movement of religious reform which
disputed the legitimacy of the Shi'i Fatimid power. Ås such, it forms a part of the history of the debates
amongst the schools of law and the quarrels between orthodox and heterodox Muslim doctrines.

Nevertheless, and despite their coercive appeal for å return to orthodoxy, their theological rigour and
their brutal methods of ideological indoctrination, they could put up no resistance to the climate of
religious coexistence in Andalusia, to the urban life style in the trading towns of the Sahel, or to the
political and economic needs created by the geography of the territories they controlled. All that
remained therefore was their solid politico-military organization and their aristocratic conviction of
belonging to an elite which had come from the south to assist the western Muslim world.

A Profound Cultural Impact

The effective geopolitical unity of the immense territories controlled by the Almoravids from Senegal to
the Ebro, was, however, short lived. The vitality of African cultures, the extreme harshness of the Saharan
climate, and the Ameoravids' lack of adequate military resources, meant that their task was
disproportionate to the means at their disposal.

As the masters for several decades of an area extending from the West African gold trading centres to the
Mediterranean and European zones where gold coinage was in great demand, the Almoravids kept tight
control over the anchor points of the transsaharan traffic, and thus made substantial gains from the wealth
of these territories, both in political and economic terms.

Their dinars, the famous marabotins, coins of the finest quality, were the currency of this period. This led

to the Almoravids being considered by their African, Mediterranean and European contemporaries as one
of the greatest powers of that period. Very few of these coins can be found today since they were mostly

20

melted down at the time by other
Mediterranean and European states 1n
order to mint their own money
containing much less gold.

Political unification had a lasting
economic impact thanks to the revival
of transsaharan trade. The gold was
exchanged for goods from the Maghrib
and Andalusia (cloth, metal work,
jewellery, beads and spices) and
manuscripts, especially jurisprudence
manuals and works on Islamic theology
and Arab grammar. Close links between
intellectuals enabled Islam to spread
through the circulation of manuscripts
between al-Andalus, the Maghrib and
the Sahel.

In the western Mediterranean region

and along the adjacent Atlantic coasts,

the frequent sea crossings, necessary for
Arabic coin of the 11%--12%-century military and administrative purposes, had
a positive and lasting effect on the development of the navy and navigation. Lisbon and the ports situated
further south, Cadiz, Sevilla, Ceuta, Malaga, Almeria and Denia, as well as the Balearic Islands, benefited
greatly from this development of maritime and harbour activities. However, it is their architectural and
artistic achievements, as well as their role in the cross-cultural influences between Spain, the Maghrib, the
Sahara and the Sahel, which stand out among the cultural contributions made by the Almoravids. Their very
elaborate stucco-work, the widespread use of marble tomb stones, even in the south at Gao (Mali), the
integrated urbanisation of Marrakech whose many monuments still bear their mark, the construction of

palaces and mosques, all provide evidence of their skill as builders, while highlighting their aesthetic purity.

The Almoravid hegemony thus contributed to the proliferation and merging of the intercultural routes
of al-Andalus and to their extension to the Saharan and Sahelian regions of West Africa. Marrakech, their
capital, was greatly influenced by Andalusian culture. Power and wealth flowed into al-Andalus from the
south, and, after the first centuries of Shi'ite or Kharijite Islamisation, the caravan routes became vectors
for the spread of Sunnism. Al- Andalus drew upon these new sources of inspiration, notwithstanding the
initial difficulties caused by the rigour of the "veiled desert warriers”. — However they very quickly
adapted to the Andalusian civilisation. This adaptation enabled al-Andalus to perpetuate its role as åa
cultural crossroads, and is an indication of the scale and impact of this culture of cultural convergence
which succeeded in overcoming the characteristic roughness of the Almoravids.

AL-ANDALUS: SCIENTIFIC HERITAGE
AND EUROPEAN THOUGHT

Pierre Philippe REY

Al-Andalus, lying to the north of the Maghrib, to the south of Europe, is the heir to the rationalist,
philosophical and scientific thought of ancient Persia and Greece, reformulated in the light of the
universalism born of the fertile dialectic between the three great monotheistic religions whose
coexistence it made possible. It was this new universalist rationalism that al-Andalus transmitted to North
Europe, either directly or via Sicily, its twin sister.

One figure more than any other marks this Andalusian origin of European rationalism: that of Ibn Rushd,
Averroés, physician, Jurist and philosopher. We shall discuss him at some length. However, the figure of
Averroés is but the culmination of åa lengthy process.

There is indeed a veritable "road of universalist rationality”. which should be explored, stage by stage, Just
as the silk road and the routes travelled by gold and spices are studied. Its starting-point is the Maghrib-
Muslim West African nexus for it was there, in the eighth century of the Christian Era, that two currents of
Kharijism flourished, namely, Ibadism (which survives today in the Maghrib: at Mzab in Algeria, at Djerba
in Tunisia and at Djebel Nafusa in Libya, as well as in Oman and in Zanzibar), and Sufrism (which died out
several centuries ago). These currents, which had remained highly democratic since their establishment in
Arabia, came into contact with, and subsequently merged with, the tradition of clan-based democracy of
the Imazighen (as the Berbers call themselves) of North Africa. Indeed, it was this encounter that led to the
triumph of Islam in North Africa, since whereas the first orthodox Sunni Muslim conquerors, following in
the wake of '"Uqbah ibn Naåfi', himself defeated and killed in a battle against the Amazigh chief Kusaylah,
had failed to convert the Imazighen by force of arms, a few poor, peaceful missionaries, armed with nothing
but their knowledge (they were referred to as "bearers of knowledge”,
*hamallet et ilm'), would spread the dissident Sufrite and Ibadite doctrines
the length and breadth of the region. Furthermore, the Imazighen clans
underwent å mass conversion to this dissident, democratic form of Islam
because it united them and thereby enabled them to resist more effectively
the new attempts at conquest launched by the Easterners. In other words,
the mass, root and branch Islamization of the Imazighen (Berbers) occurred
as åa means of countering the Arab conquest.

Thus, by the eighth century of the Christian era, the scientific and
technical achievements of Greece and Persia had been reformulated and
developed by this dissident current of Islam established in the Maghrib,
as well as in Oman at the same time. But whereas access to knowledge in
the highly hierarchical society of ancient Persia, and even 1n the limited
democracy of Greece, was reserved for an elite, the Ibadites made

knowledge available to all, with a concern to provide widespread —Abd-al-Rahman arrives at the Iberian
peninsula in 755.

education that would not occur again in human history until after the French Revolution. Å transition
may thus be said to have occurred from an initiatory conception of knowledge to a universalist
conception. Indeed, the Ibadites would soon abandon the offensive Holy War as a means of disseminating
their doctrine, opting instead for education as a way of spreading knowledge.

By the end of the eighth century, the doctrine was crossing the Sahara and would lead to the
development in Black Africa of the only version of Islam that would be known there for centuries and
that would accompany the expansion of the Soninke, and later the Malinke, diasporas, which Arabic-
speakers refer to as Wangara and which is today known as Dyula. Dyula Islam, codified in the fifteenth
century by al-Hajj Salim Suware, may be regarded in its main lines as a legacy of Ibadism and indeed,
one of the main Islamizing Wangara-Dyula groups, the Saghanogha, was Ibadite in the mid-fourteenth
century, according to Ibn Battuta. The emergence of this universalist, rationalist current of Islam south of
the Sahara was so close in time to its establishment in North Africa that we cannot but conclude that the
starting-point of the road of universalist rationality is the North Africa-Muslim West Africa nexus, and
that this movement began in the eighth century of the Christian era.

In Spain, the dissemination of this religious current among the Imazighen (who from the outset accounted
for two thirds of the Muslim population established in Spain) culminated in the great uprising of the
Imazighen against the Eastern Arabs in 742, an uprising that undoubtedly serves far more satisfactorily than
the battle of Poitiers to explain the halting of the Muslim expansion towards northern Europe. The Arab
groups living in Spain, themselves divided between those who hailed originally from "Arabia Felix” and
those who came from the Arabian desert, would succeed in restoring the situation only when the
Umayyad, driven from the East by the 'Abbasids (750), had established themselves there. But the Umayyads
very quickly realized that they could govern only Spain with the support of the demographically dominant
Muslim element, that is, the Imazighen, and this they would continue to do until their dynasty died out
at the beginning of the eleventh century. Throughout the duration of the Ibadite imamate of Tahart in
North Africa and even later (see in this connection the support given by the Umayyads to the radical
Ibadite uprising of Abu Yazid against the Fatimids from 943 to 946), the Umayyads would maintain å
special alliance with the Ibadites of North Africa which would serve as a conduit for these Ibadites'
scientific and technical knowledge - for example, in mathematics, in astronomy, in matters of navigation
and the irrigation of arid zones, but also in history (the great Andalusian historian al- Warrak would gather
directly from the son of Abu Yazid, who had taken refuge in Andalusia after the defeat and death of his
father, information on Berber genealogies and on North Africa, which would later be reproduced by al-
Bakri and after him by Ibn Khaldun). Nevertheless, the Umayyads, and even the Imazighen of Spain as å
whole, would not embrace Ibadism, but would in their vast majority become Sunnites of the Malikite
school. This Malikism, was, however essentially open and tolerant, as was Ibadism itself.

Over a century elapsed between the fall of the Umayyads of Spain and the birth of Averroés, but it was
during the period marked by the intense interchange of ideas and wealth between Wangara Black Africa,
Ibadite North Africa and Umayyad Spain that the Andalusian culture that would flourish in the following
centuries was formed.

That flowering was reflected during the tenth, eleventh and twelfth centuries in a shifting of the scientific
centre of gravity of the Muslim world from East to West. Whereas in the eighth and ninth centuries all

23

EG os V
the renowned scholars of the Muslim world were concentrated in Baghdad, in the tenth and eleventh
centuries Cördoba would overtake Baghdad in this respect and surpass the entire East in the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries, Cairo incidentally enjøying åa growing ascendancy parallel to that of Cördoba, albeit
on a more limited scale (cf. Paul Benoit and Frangoise Michaud, L'intermédiaire arabe?”, maps on pp. 158
and 159, in Michel Serres, Eléments d'Histoire des Sciences, Bordas, 3rd edition, 1994).

This road of Muslim science, from East to West, as charted by the authors we have just cited, does not
pass via Ibadite Tahart or Djebel Nafusa, despite the considerable number of scholars that å historian such
as Tadeusz Lewicki has been able to identify at those same periods, according to the chronicles of the
Ibadites themselves. No doubt this is because the sources drawn upon by the authors of the maps referred
to (Dictionary of Scientific Biographies and Encyclopedia of Islam) do not attribute to the Ibadite scholars
sufficient influence outside their religious current to justify their inclusion in their surveys, but it is
certainly also because knowledge in the Ibadite world, particularly in the centuries considered here, was
so widely spread that no one individual stands out as being particularly eminent. Thus, we are dealing
here with åa body of knowledge available to the masses not just to an elite. However, that the road passed
through Tahart and the Dyula world (where the names of Baaasna å

scholars are wholly unknown, with the exception of the &
collective name Saghanogho and, much later on, the
individual name of al-Hajj Salim Suware Cisse) is a fact
deeply etched in the history of Muslim philosophy, the
falasifa, while in the East, the falasifa - the term itself is the
Persian-Arabic corruption of its Greek name, filosofia - Was
proceeding to self-destruct. This is clearly apparent in the
movement which led from Ibn Sina (985-1036, Avicenna in
mediaeval Europe), a Persian deeply marked by Greek
philosophy, to al-Ghazali (died in 1111), also å Persian, born
in Khurasan, who sought to destroy the Graeco-Persian
rationalist legacy of the earlier Muslim philsophers (of
whom Avicenna was the most illustrious exemplar) and the
establishment of radical atheism. Such was the objective of. —
al-Ghazali's work, Tahafut al-falasifa, "Destruction” or G rn
"Incoherence” of Philosophy. The passage of ideas via Ibadite |
universalism and its scientific impact upon Andalusia
enabled the Andalusian Ibn Rushd (1126-1198, Averroés in
mediaeval Europe) to settle this dispute among Persians (or Graeco-Persians). He replied to al-Ghazali
with his Tahufut al-Tahafut, Destruction of Destruction or Incoherence of Incoherence - å title so Hegelian that it
is today difficult to realize it was penned by a twelfth-century philosopher - in which he established that
there was no contradiction between the elitist discourse of the philosophers and the universalist discourse
of religion, these being simply two methods of expounding a single truth. Accordingly, when revelation
entered into contradiction with reason as constituted by the philosophers, it must be reinterpreted until
that contradiction was resolved. Thus there emerged å new universal, that of Reason, an immanent
universal that during the following centuries would gradually replace the transcendental universal of
Revelation.

It was indeed in Andalusia that universal reason, as distinct from religion, came into being, whereas,
among the Ibadites of North Africa, knowledge, Ilm, was the unity of universalist religious knowledge
and of the secular technical and scientific legacy of the Greeks and Persians (the Ibadite imams of Tahart,
the Rustamids, were the descendants of one of the most renowned Persian families; one of their ancestors
was the general in command of the Sassanid troups at the battle of Qadisiyya where, in year 14 of the
Hegira, the Persians suffered their first major defeat at the hands of the Muslims; through them much
Persian science was transmitted). In Andalusia in the twelfth century, reason won its independence. This
was åa development largely determined by the epoch, the result of the great expansion of science and
technology. Among the contemporaries of Averroés, two names very close to his testify to åa community
of approach: that of his companion Ibn Tufayl and that of Ibn Maymun, å Jew by religion (known in
medieval Europe by the name of Maimonides).

Averroés' rationalist message crossed in the following century into France. Indeed, it came very close to
being carried directly into Germany, for the German Emperor Frederick II of Hohenstaufen, grandson
through his father of Frederick Barbarossa, was at the same time King of Sicily as grandson through his
mother of Roger of Sicily, the first Norman conqueror of the island. However, the Norman king had
continued to maintain a Muslim court, changing but little the island's way of life: and it was, inter alia,
to him that was dedicated the major work of the great Arab geographer al-Idrissi, accordingly known as
the Kitab Rujar, the "Book of Roger”. Frederick II carried still further this trend within Sicily, while at
the same time establishing ties abroad with the Ayyubid dynasty in Cairo and Damascus. Thanks to these
ties, he was able to make a peaceful entry into Jerusalem, which the Crusader armies had failed to
conquer by force. Successive Popes vowed implacable hatred against him and although, thanks in
particular to his Sicilian Muslim armies, he managed throughout his life to withstand them, they wreaked
their vengeance on his descendants, whom they exterminated to the last man, woman and child.
Frederick II caused to be built in the mainland part of the Kingdom of Sicily, that is, in the south of Italy,
a University which provided å debating forum for the most brilliant minds of the age - Christian, Jew
and Muslim. There, Averroés exercised great influence, and his works, together with those of Aristotle,
Ptolemy and others, were translated into Latin. Frederick II, who wielded sufficient political power to be
able to do so, proclaimed an atheism that was far more pronounced than that of Averroés. But the
destruction of his dynasty meant that his achievements were short-lived. However, his principal minister
in Sicily, Thomas of Acerra or Thomas Aquinas, had a nephew who, imbued at a very early age with Arab
culture and Averroism in that university, was to become, as Saint Thomas Aquinas, at once the chief critic
and the main propagator of Averroist theories in Christendom.

The Papacy having got the better, if not of Frederick II himself then of his offspring, it was in France that
Averroist thought was to spread most widely. There were several geopolitical reasons for this; without being
truly allies, the King of France, Philippe Auguste, and the young Emperor Frederick II were fighting the
same enemies, the Saxons and the Anglo-Saxons.The battle of Bouvines (1214), an event familiar to many
a French schoolchild, was one episode in those convergent struggles. Philippe Auguste, who was also
distrustful of the Papacy, began to endow the University of Paris with its own statutes as early as 1215 (the
year after the battle of Bouvines). A few decades later it became, notably in its faculty of arts (in which
students underwent their first years of schooling, and obtained their first university degrees), an Averroist
stronghold. In the mid-thirteenth century, two of the most renowned "Latin Averroists”, Siger of Brabant
and Boece (Boethius) of Daclus, lectured there on the thought of the Andalusian master, who was thus,

25

nearly four centuries before Descartes, at the origin of French rationalist thinking. It was there, then, that
Saint Thomas Aquinas went in order to combat (apparently) but also to spread (in reality) the new
rationalism, although his work Against Averroés, De unitate intellectus contra Averroistas, is, in fact, directed
more against the "Latin” Averroists than against Averroés himself.

Subsequently, this universalist current of rationalist thought would pursue its course in France, leading on
in the seventeenth century to the systems of the great philosopher-mathematician-physicists, Descartes,
Pascal and Leibniz (Leibniz, though a German, wrote part of his philosophical work in French; a great
student of Aristotle, he had also translated a philosophical allegory by Ibn Tufayl, the friend and rival of
Averroés), and in the eighteenth century to the
naturalism of Buffon and the evolutionism of Lamarck,
before culminating in the French Enlightenment, with
the Encyclopedists, Voltaire and Rousseau.

It reached its apogee with the French Revolution, which
took place under the standard of universal reason but led
on to å philosophy of Freedom, fully developed by Hegel,
in which reason, triumphant from the twelfth century to
the eighteenth, came to be merged with, but also
subordinated to, the principal construction of the human
mind, namely, the principle of humanity's freedom.

Such then was the road followed by universalist reason.
Its birthplace, in the eighth and ninth centuries, was
North Africa and West (Black) Africa. Andalusia was the
arena of its struggle to win independence from
revelation, during the tenth, eleventh and above all the
twelfth centuries. It was mainly in France that the work
of construction would be pursued, and that reason
would continue its conquest, stage by stage, of all that
formerly had pertained to revelation. Its total victory,
with the French Revolution, brought about its
subordination to an all-encompassing ultimate goal;
freedom.

Cloister of Monreale in Sicily

Today, Europe is tempted by a return to anti-rationalism, of which Nazism reawakened, in the
second third of this century, the terrifying spectre. In order to combat this new wave of anti-rationalism,
which is currently threatening to submerge us, Europe must stop believing that its rationalist thought was
born and embodied solely in Europe itself. Rationalism came to Europe from elsewhere: from North
Africa, from West Africa and from that Andalusia which belongs geographically to Europe, although
Europe itself constantly attempts to forget that it owes to it what constitutes its essence. Only if it is
capable of restoring its links, through the history of Andalusia, with North Africa and West Africa, the
starting-point of the road of universalist rationality, and if it is able to give them the place due to them,
that is, as the matrix of its very being, will Europe avoid the new decline with which it is threatened.
