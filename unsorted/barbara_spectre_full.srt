00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,840
 Good evening. I'm Leah Zinder. This week, close up goes abroad. Every now and then we

2
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,480
 believe it's important to take a look at Jewish communities outside of Israel. Many

3
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,960
 of them suffering as a result of Muslim immigration and the intense anti-Israel

4
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,260
 sentiment that's sweeping Europe. This week we travel to the capital of Sweden. A

5
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:41,580
 country we don't generally associate with anti-Semitism. Here's our report.

6
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:45,680
 Good evening and welcome to this week's edition of Close Up which this week

7
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,320
 visits Sweden. A country that until recently was considered one of the world's

8
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,160
 most successful liberal democracies. That's not the way it looks today to many

9
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,480
 of the 20,000 Jews who live here.

10
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:06,520
 The Swedish capital with boats and water everywhere between the 14 islands

11
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,600
 comprising the city is as prosperous and serene as ever. But under the surface

12
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,380
 Stockholm, like other places in Sweden and in Europe, is struggling with problems

13
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,320
 of rapidly expanding immigration and a new incarnation of a painfully familiar

14
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:28,940
 phenomenon, anti-Semitism. This is Malmo, 600 kilometers south of Stockholm.

15
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:35,160
 Malmo has a tiny and rapidly shrinking Jewish community. 700 Jews live here amid

16
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,920
 an influx of Muslim immigrants whose numbers have reached 50,000. Just two

17
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,680
 weeks ago, a makeshift bomb was hurled at the old synagogue in Malmo. It damaged

18
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,200
 but didn't destroy the building. Fortunately, no one was hurt. This was just

19
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,120
 the latest in a string of anti-Jewish hate crimes in Malmo including vandalizing

20
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:59,640
 the cemetery, fire bombings, graffiti and verbal abuse in the streets. The mayor of

21
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,600
 Malmo, Ilmar Appalu, says "I'm against anti-Semitism" and he adds "against

22
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,040
 Zionism". He recommends that Jews distance themselves from Israel if they

23
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,600
 want to prevent anti-Semitic attacks. Things have become so bad here that many

24
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,320
 of the younger Jews of Malmo decided to leave. Some for Stockholm, others for

25
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:25,080
 Israel. Yakov Guman Schat says he saw the writing on the wall six years ago. He now

26
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,600
 lives in Tel Aviv. I had a very good childhood. I was never had any problems

27
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:38,440
 being Jewish and I would never in my wildest fantasies think while growing up

28
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:47,160
 that I would once leave Sweden because of these reasons. And I think and I hope

29
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:55,560
 that at least here my children can grow up safe in that point of view. Although

30
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,440
 there are a lot of other dangers here but at least they won't have to be ashamed

31
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:06,100
 of them being Jewish. Is Malmo typical of the Jewish experience in Sweden and what

32
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,180
 is the source of these anti-Semitic attacks? Is it the influx of Muslim

33
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:15,220
 immigrants or is it the bitterly hostile attitude toward Israel adopted by the

34
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,660
 political and media establishment of the country? And what are the Jews of Sweden

35
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,980
 saying about the situation? These are some of the questions we try to answer on

36
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:30,320
 close up this week on location in Stockholm. This is Rabbi Yitzchat Naqman,

37
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:35,300
 the Orthodox Rabbi of Stockholm. He presides over a small but vibrant community

38
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,700
 that worships at the Adati-Srael synagogue, a synagogue that survived

39
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,420
 Kristallnacht in Hamburg Germany and was sent over to Sweden for safe keeping.

40
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:49,460
 Ever since its inauguration in 1940 this synagogue has held morning prayer

41
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:55,060
 services every day of the week. But this is also a diminishing community. There

42
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:01,100
 are 140 funerals a year in the Jewish community and only five weddings. And now

43
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:06,420
 Rabbi Naqman easily identifiable as a Jew by his kippah and beard as more

44
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,220
 immediate problems. He's been verbally attacked and threatened on the streets

45
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:15,980
 of Stockholm twice in recent weeks. It might be so that it has become more

46
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:22,540
 dangerous and clearly the security department in the Jewish community told

47
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:29,460
 me not to always use some kind of a hat, not go with a with the

48
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,620
 skull cap with a kippah and is that what you're doing? That's what I started to do

49
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:40,740
 reluctantly. I feel somewhat and I don't I do feel that the Jew should be able to

50
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:46,600
 go with a kippah on his hat. It's a very dangerous past chosen by the some

51
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:53,900
 politician and some intellectuals to actually blame the the victim for

52
00:04:53,900 --> 00:05:01,500
 antisemitism. The Jews have a long history in Sweden beginning centuries ago. The

53
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,460
 conservative community of Stockholm worships in this magnificent synagogue

54
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:10,620
 built in 1871 and the Swedes who remained neutral throughout World War Two

55
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:16,140
 have a proud record of helping save 8,000 Jews from Denmark during the Holocaust.

56
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:20,940
 Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg who saved thousands of Jews in Budapest in

57
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:25,900
 the same dark era is memorialized in this controversial and it must be said

58
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,820
 odd sculpture erected by the government close to the Jewish center in Stockholm.

59
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:37,340
 I can't help feeling this towering hero deserves a more imposing monument. Now

60
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:41,180
 the Jewish school in Stockholm is busily preparing for the new school year. A

61
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:46,380
 teacher at the school, Jessica Rothschild, born in Stockholm like her parents before

62
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:51,180
 her says she feels at home here and isn't afraid. I don't know I don't see the

63
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,820
 problem outside. I feel it when I read in newspaper where I feel it when I read

64
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:00,100
 about Malmer the community Jewish community in Malmer but I don't feel it's

65
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:06,740
 so close and but I don't wear my gandavid. You don't wear it why? Because I'm

66
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:12,540
 little I am afraid of course that people will see that I'm Jewish and my kids

67
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:17,860
 don't sing they love to sing Jewish songs in the underground but sometimes I

68
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:22,980
 change it to Swedish songs or I let them just sing. The entire Swedish Jewish

69
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:28,500
 community 18,000 strong feels threatened. The Jewish community center and the

70
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,500
 synagogues have heavy security and are protected with locks and bulletproof

71
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,540
 glass. A security officer who refused to appear on camera said when events

72
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,180
 happen in the Middle East like the flotilla the Jewish centers are provided

73
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,660
 with round-the-clock police protection, threats to community leaders or routine

74
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,900
 and that's a problem for the leader of this community for the first time in

75
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:54,940
 Sweden a woman, Lena Posnek Karashi. The problem is which we are fighting very

76
00:06:54,940 --> 00:07:00,940
 hard here is to make everyone from the police, legislators, parliamentarians,

77
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:06,180
 media to understand that being Jewish is not necessarily the same as being

78
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:11,620
 Israeli. What's going on in Israel is not the same as what the Jews in Sweden

79
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:18,540
 we are not responsible for what's going on in Israel and this is problematic in

80
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:23,260
 one way because of course we care and we would never accept any bashing. On the

81
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:27,180
 other hand we are not responsible so when there are demonstrations against

82
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:32,660
 Israel all these demonstrations end up outside not the Israeli embassy they

83
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:38,900
 continue to the Jewish school or the Jewish community regardless of

84
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:43,420
 where in Sweden. This is problematic because those who are against Israel are

85
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:49,140
 against the Jews and these are not the Swedes these are not necessarily the

86
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:55,660
 left-wingers. These are Muslim fundamentalists or Islamists. Is it dangerous for a

87
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:01,580
 Jew who is who looks like a Jew to walk the streets of Stockholm of Sweden

88
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:07,660
 today? Most Jews today don't feel comfortable walking in certain areas in

89
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:13,300
 the country in the various cities where there is a large Muslim population and

90
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:19,100
 if you're a visible Jew either because it's shown because you look like an

91
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:24,260
 orthodox the men or if you walk around with a Magindavid like I do or you're a

92
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:33,180
 public figure like I am. Of course you are bound to be cursed or abused in one

93
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:38,660
 way or another. Of course this is the fact today. You say of course it's shocking

94
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:43,420
 that you say of course because that's where we are today. That's where if you're

95
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:49,700
 a visible Jew today there are groups who would want to abuse you or verbally

96
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:54,140
 attack you or be aggressive and you don't really feel that you have the

97
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:59,500
 protection of your government. Is that correct? The thing is that without going

98
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:04,220
 into details the police and authority are well aware of the situation and so we

99
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:11,420
 are protected as individuals but this is not an acceptable situation and the

100
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:20,620
 government even if we've been trying very hard they don't understand and there

101
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:27,620
 are two levels. One level is to get the protection we need and for this they

102
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:32,980
 need to identify and understand that this is a situation. The other thing is to

103
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:37,620
 work politically against its situation to say that in a democratic society like

104
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:42,780
 Sweden we have counter-situation when there are groups in this country

105
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:49,220
 especially now the Jews who are not who can't feel free in the streets and

106
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:54,420
 can't feel comfortable we've been here for 250 years. What's happening here? The

107
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,540
 government of Sweden has become one of the most virulent critics of Israel's

108
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:01,620
 policies in recent years especially when it comes to Lebanon, Gaza and the West

109
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:07,860
 Bank. Now this criticism combined with a potent mix of latent prejudice radical

110
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,780
 left-wing ideology and Islamic incitement all this has produced an

111
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:18,380
 ominous wave of antisemitism that is washing over Sweden. Antisemitism that is

112
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:22,500
 of concern to a young member of the Swedish Parliament called Friedrich Marne.

113
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:29,740
 The conflicts in the Middle East seems to catalyze some and activate some

114
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:35,100
 anti-Semitic feelings among probably a quite small group in Sweden but at least

115
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,060
 I mean they are here and they are at least as many as they can cause trouble

116
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:44,820
 for people. And the most worrying thing I think is that the man I believe is the

117
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:51,020
 Chancellor for justice very high official in the justice ministry appears

118
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:56,220
 to be tolerant towards this antisemitism. What he is saying is that the very

119
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:04,820
 strict laws in Sweden against racism do not apply to antisemitism because of

120
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:09,820
 the conflict in the Middle East. Is that correct? There are people who argue like

121
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,820
 that. I think that they are wrong. And there are also people who argue that all

122
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:19,340
 troubles in the world would be gone if just you find a two-state solution on

123
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,620
 the conflict in the Middle East. Like people should not blow themselves up in

124
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:30,400
 Iraq or that terrorists in Somalia would end fighting if the Palestinians got a

125
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,100
 country and so on. And I don't believe in those. I don't think that Israel should

126
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,380
 be in the middle of the world all the time in the middle of all conflicts that

127
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,900
 everything has to do with Israel. That everything has to do with antisemitism and

128
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:46,300
 the Jews. I think that Israel should be a normal country which we treat like

129
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:55,260
 we treat other countries in the world. Sadly people don't really and they mix

130
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:59,740
 it up. The conflict in the Middle East with the situation for Jewish people

131
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:05,380
 living in Malman and Stockholm. It's sad that it should be that way. Let me ask

132
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:09,700
 you a personal question if I may. You are a young member of parliament an

133
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:15,220
 up-and-coming young politician who obviously has personal ambitions as well

134
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,620
 and you want to serve your country. It cannot be a very popular cause right now

135
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:25,300
 in Sweden to be defending the Jews. Why are you doing it? When I look at it I

136
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:36,340
 used to say that the star of David, Mag and David, we can choose now. We can

137
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,820
 choose if we want to star of David to be on Israel flag or if you want to

138
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:47,740
 star of David to be on the Jew in Treblinka. The history has shown us

139
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:55,660
 that there is nothing in between there. If Israel would not be an independent

140
00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:01,060
 country today we don't even know how the situation would be like. More

141
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:06,420
 typical are the views of another MP from the Green Party named Mehmet Kaplan a

142
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:11,060
 Muslim. He was one year old when his parents immigrated to Sweden from Turkey.

143
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:16,220
 Kaplan was on board the May 31st Turkish Fotilla to Gaza though not on the

144
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:21,420
 Marvie Marmara. He says the ship to Gaza Sweden organization is planning to

145
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:25,980
 launch another flotilla before the end of this year. Talking to us in the Swedish

146
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:31,140
 Parliament he says he has visited Israel twice has friends there and denies that

147
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:36,340
 his fierce criticism of Israel mostly for its Gaza policies is based on anti-Israel

148
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:42,100
 prejudice or antisemitism. I don't pretend that we can understand fully what's

149
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:47,580
 happening in the area but we can understand that people civilians are

150
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:54,140
 suffering from the blockade. They are suffering and as a humanist as

151
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:59,500
 people living in a modern country like Israel and like in Sweden we have to

152
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,700
 protest we have to do things about this. But here's the problem as I see it and I'm

153
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:08,220
 not here to discuss I'm not here to to claim that everything that Israel's

154
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:13,380
 government does is correct. I don't think that's the issue. The point is as we both

155
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:19,620
 know perfectly well hundreds if not thousands of Muslim civilians are being

156
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:24,060
 killed in Afghanistan correct by the Allied forces. We don't hear a word of

157
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:30,500
 protest about that. There is this insistence on bashing Israel and this is

158
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:35,620
 used by Israel's enemies around the world to delegitimize Israel and what I see

159
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,980
 here in Sweden in the short time that I've been here but judging from what

160
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:43,580
 people have told me and you know it very well in places like Malmo this Israel

161
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:49,940
 bashing has turned into a real threat to the Jewish community of Sweden. I can say

162
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:55,420
 like this I am one of the persons who are fighting racism antisemitism and

163
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:59,780
 Islamophobia and this is actually why I have this situation and I have this

164
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:08,020
 entrenched in the Swedish public arena because I'm working against racism based

165
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:16,220
 on whatever. Would you Mr. Kaplan go to Malmo and and get up there publicly and say

166
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:22,620
 to the what is it 50,000 Muslims who live there who have been torching

167
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,220
 synagogues who have been attacking Jews would you stand up and say okay you may

168
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:32,940
 be critical of Israel but you dare not attack Jews here in Sweden. I have already

169
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:40,380
 been in Malmo just three days ago and I was meeting Muslim organization leaders

170
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,860
 and we were talking about many things about the Islamophobia in this

171
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,740
 community about the situation with discrimination but also about the

172
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:54,020
 situation with antisemitism and when we are talking about these issues I can

173
00:15:54,020 --> 00:16:00,300
 guarantee you that I'm very very open and because I think that this society with

174
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:06,980
 the growing so-called Swedish Democrats it's a right-wing extremist party who

175
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:12,580
 are addressing the Islamophobic views who are talking about that Muslims and

176
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:17,180
 Islam is a threat for Europe and Sweden. And who by the way according to the

177
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,260
 polls will probably get into the party. Yeah they are just on the on the

178
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:28,180
 barrage now. They they are coming from a culture which was very very strong

179
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:34,100
 antisemitic culture this party so I think that we have problems both with

180
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:40,060
 antisemitism and Islamophobia in the society and I think that somebody who's

181
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:47,100
 working against racism in total must work with both antisemitism and Islamophobia.

182
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,740
 Is Mehmed Kaplan right? Is Swedish criticism of Israeli policies in Gaza

183
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:56,300
 legitimate protest? Is there rhetoric unrelated to antisemitism and public

184
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,900
 opinion? We went out into the streets of Stockholm to ask a few Swedes what they

185
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:05,900
 think. In my opinion what I know from Sweden I don't I had never have been to

186
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:10,980
 Israel but I think it's really wrong. What exactly is wrong? I've seen people in

187
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:18,260
 a little community they can't you build big walls and stuff around them

188
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:23,460
 and I think that's wrong but I understand also that I don't know

189
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:27,700
 anything because I'm here in Sweden and I have it's really good here and I don't

190
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:32,980
 have any terrorists and you know so it's easy to have an opinion but that's

191
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:38,580
 that's what we learn here. Do you think that what's happening in Israel affects

192
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:43,380
 the way people see the Jewish community here in Sweden? Not here in Sweden I

193
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:48,300
 don't think. I don't anyway I can't speak for everybody but I don't see

194
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:53,940
 anything wrong in the Jewish occupation here in Sweden. I don't know why

195
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:58,780
 they're fighting but it's just you know they want to take gas and stuff like

196
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:04,100
 that but I'm not sure I can't say anything about it because I don't know

197
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:09,780
 why. I just think it's it's annoying and does does what's happening over there

198
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:15,300
 affect the way you feel about the Jews here in Sweden? We feel nothing of well

199
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:19,820
 the Jews they're they're people just that they're called Jews so we have no

200
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:23,660
 opinion about them at all. Lots of things that the Israelis are doing that I

201
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:29,220
 don't appreciate that I don't condone but I think they're very much in their

202
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:34,740
 right to to do things to defend themselves and to defend the country

203
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:39,660
 they have. And you are aware of course that there is a lot of criticism against

204
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,580
 Israel here in Sweden and also a fair amount of anti-Semitism do you do you

205
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:49,740
 feel that at all? I can't say that I feel it but I know that it that it's

206
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,740
 there and I hear from other people that it is. What exactly is it that you're

207
00:18:53,740 --> 00:19:05,180
 hearing? Oh it's not easy to I couldn't really say but I know of you know young

208
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:09,280
 Swedish Jews who don't want to carry the the Star of David for example

209
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,860
 visibly because they're afraid of what's gonna happen and I think Swedish youth

210
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:19,860
 should not have to be afraid of things like that no matter what their background

211
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:25,220
 or religion is. And do you feel that you as a supporter of Israel are in a

212
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:34,100
 minority here in Sweden? Yes it has changed all the way up to the

213
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:40,180
 the Six Day War or even about 1970 most Swedes were supporters of Israel but

214
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:45,740
 then gradually it's it's changed and I think that if you study this more

215
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:51,220
 closely you're going to find that part of the the stance that people take

216
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:58,300
 against Israel has more to do with anti-Semitism than with the policies of

217
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:03,820
 the state of Israel. As we heard there are people in Sweden who support Israel

218
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:08,180
 and have a deep sense of the injustice of the present situation. It's these

219
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:12,020
 people who give hope to those who still believe that things will get better

220
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:16,940
 here. One of them is Barb Respector, a former American who made Aliyah and then

221
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:21,900
 ten years ago with the help of the Government of Sweden set up a non-denominational

222
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:27,300
 Institute of Jewish Learning with a Greek name of Pidea here in Stockholm.

223
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:32,380
 She believes the current wave of anti-Semitism in Sweden will pass and that

224
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:37,780
 Jews have an important role to play in a country undergoing profound change. I

225
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:42,780
 think there's a resurgence of anti-Semitism because at this point in time

226
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,900
 Europe has not yet learned how to be multicultural and I think we're going

227
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:51,620
 to be part of the throes of that of that transformation which must take place.

228
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:57,820
 Europe is not going to be the monolithic societies that they once were in the

229
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:01,340
 last century. Jews are going to be at the center of that. It's a huge

230
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:05,980
 transformation for Europe to make. They are now going into a multicultural mode

231
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:10,740
 and Jews will be resented because of our leading role but without that leading

232
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:15,000
 role and without that transformation Europe will not survive.

233
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,500
 Pidea is a proponent of the liberal inclusive world view that was once

234
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:24,660
 identified with Sweden. A world view that now ironically appears to exclude the

235
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:31,060
 Jews. Do you think the Jewish community in Sweden has a future? It depends of

236
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:39,420
 course you can always live in a bubble as people do around here but personally I

237
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:44,260
 think it will be dwindling both for political reasons and religious reasons.

238
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:50,320
 People who will see that a Jewish future is important for the kids. They will leave

239
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,580
 Sweden either to Israel or to England or to other countries and I think that the

240
00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:02,020
 political situation will only worsen with a growing aggressive Muslim population

241
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:08,220
 together with a maybe left-wing political government. But as you know

242
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:12,740
 Jews don't easily learn from the mistakes. I'm sure that Jews will stay in

243
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:18,420
 Sweden also. So let me ask you a question then. What are you doing here and how

244
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:24,460
 many of you or of the other Jewish people in Sweden are talking about

245
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:35,540
 leaving possibly moving to Israel? Or to Copenhagen. What we're doing here I'm a

246
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:42,140
 child of a survivor and the majority of the community members are children and

247
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:47,700
 grandchildren of Holocaust survivors. My grandparents were murdered. I would

248
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:54,220
 never as an individual. I would never ever give in to anything that is

249
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:58,700
 threatening the Jews and our existence. We are entitled to live and work wherever

250
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:06,420
 we want and I get so upset and this is a political battle and this is to get the

251
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:11,020
 recognition if and when I make Aliyah myself because that was the dream of my

252
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:14,940
 life it's because I love Israel. It's not because I'm fleeing this country

253
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:20,420
 because I want to feel that my children if they want to live in Sweden they

254
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:24,740
 should have all the possibilities to do so without feeling threatened and this

255
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:31,380
 is the work we have to do and that's why I think that we if we want we can be

256
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:35,540
 here. If we want to move it should be for reasons that has nothing to do with

257
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,940
 antisemitism. Until then we are going to fight it because we are never ever

258
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:44,940
 giving in to these dark forces, anti-democratic, anti-Semitic,

259
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:51,980
 synophobic, whatever phobia you may address. So that's why we are here.

260
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:57,300
 Sweden is a country that's proud. It's liberal democratic traditions but it's a

261
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:02,660
 country where today many of the Jews living here no longer feel safe. This is

262
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:08,860
 Leah Zinder for IVA close up in Stockholm. And here we are back home and certainly

263
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:14,020
 good to be home and so there it is Sweden 2010 not only thought not a very

264
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:17,980
 comfortable place for the Jews living there. The signs are worrying but as we

265
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:21,900
 heard there are still those who believe the situation there will improve. We'd

266
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:26,580
 love to hear what you think. Do write us at IVATVNews@gmail.com. We'd like to

267
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:31,220
 thank Israel up close, the European Jewish Fund and Shoah Meislich and special

268
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,380
 thanks to my partner in this week's program Dennis Zinn. Thank you for

269
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,540
 watching close up until next Wednesday at the same time. Shalom from Jerusalem.
