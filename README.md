This is mostly documents and images related to European politics and Socialist International.
This repo is intended to be used as a WORM repo for e.g. books on the topic of EEC, EAD, UfM,
and more. 

I will keep adding stuff to this repo when I have the time. Need to digitize tons of books and documents first.
Then, annotate everything making it suitable as training material. Help's **most** welcomed.
